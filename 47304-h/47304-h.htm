<p class="pn">The cautious policy of Pericles, and the plague, combined
to render the two first years of the war barren of
incidents. The third campaign opened more energetically
with the siege of Platæa, the old and faithful ally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of Athens. This is the earliest siege of which we have
any full and particular account; and some surprise may
be felt at the rudeness and inefficacy of the means
employed in prosecuting it by the most military nation
of Greece. For this, however, all previous history prepares
us. To the early Greeks fortifications of any
strength appear to have presented insuperable obstacles.
Not a city of any note can be mentioned which was
taken by fair fighting. Troy was impregnable by force.
Eira was taken in consequence of its being accidentally
left unguarded.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Ithome held out for ten years, and at
last obtained honourable terms of surrender. And when
Cyrus marched against Babylon, the inhabitants, trusting
in their walls and their magazines, “made no account
at all of being besieged; but Cyrus became greatly puzzled
what to do, having spent much time there and made
no progress at all.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The stratagem by which he took
it at last is well known: he laid dry the bed of the
Euphrates, and introduced a body of troops through the
deserted channel; yet danger, even from this quarter,
had been foreseen and guarded against, if proper caution
had been used. Each side of the river was lined with
walls, and gates were placed at the end of the streets
which led down to the water side; so that, as Herodotus
himself remarks, if the Persians had been on their guard
the attempt might have been defeated by merely closing
the gates, and the assailants might have been cut off
entirely by missile weapons. But, to return to Platæa;
the Spartans were notoriously unskilled, even among the
Greeks, in this branch of warfare. Military engines
they had none; a want arising probably from their
national poverty; for the ram was known, and was employed,
some say invented, by Pericles, at the siege of
Samos, some years before the Peloponnesian war broke
out. It is remarkable that from this time downwards to
the invention of gunpowder, no material discovery was
made in this branch of the military art, except the introduction
of moving towers. Lines of circumvallation, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
they were the earliest, continued to be the surest means
of overcoming the pertinacious resistance of stone and
mortar. Such was the case even at Rome, after the
vast influx of wealth from conquered provinces had facilitated
the construction of the largest and most expensive
machines; and the vast scale upon which those temporary
enclosures were completed, exhibits most strikingly the
laboriousness of the Roman legionaries. This, however,
is foreign to our present subject. If the reader has
any curiosity respecting these works, he will find some
remarkable ones described in Cæsar’s Commentaries.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Just before war broke out between Athens and Sparta,
the Thebans, always jealous of Athens, and more especially
envious of its strict connection with Platæa, over
which, as the head of the B&oelig;otian confederacy, they
claimed the same undefined but oppressive authority
which was exercised by the Athenians and other leading
cities over their allies, made an attempt to gain possession
of Platæa, in concert with a party within its walls, consisting
of citizens dissatisfied with the existing government.
By the contrivance of the latter, a body of
Theban troops was introduced by night, who without a
struggle became, to all appearance, masters of the town,
piled their arms in the market&ndash;place, and invited the
inhabitants to place themselves under the protection of
Thebes. But the Athenian party was greatly preponderant,
and discovering the small number of their
enemies they took courage and assaulted them. Almost
all the Thebans were made prisoners, and subsequently
put to death, in contravention of a promise of personal
security implied, if not absolutely expressed in words.
Immediate notice of what had occurred was sent to the
Athenians, who, considering this as the commencement
of war, removed the women and children, and all who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
were unfit for military duty, from Platæa, sending thither
eighty of their own citizens to increase the garrison, and
also probably to guard against any further attempts on
the part of the disaffected.</p>

<p>No disturbance was given to Platæa during the two
first years of the war. At the commencement of the
third, Archidamus, the Spartan king and general, finding
that the annual devastation of Attica was of no service to
the Peloponnesian confederacy, and unwilling perhaps to
incur the hazard of entering an infected country,
marched to Platæa, which, in consequence of its exertions
in the Persian war, had been invested by the
general consent of Greece with privileges of an almost
sacred character. The nature of these privileges, and
the singular proposal to which they gave rise, will be
best understood from the narration of Thucydides.</p>

<p>“The next summer the Peloponnesians and their
confederates came not into Attica, but turned their arms
against Platæa, led by Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamus,
king of the Lacedæmonians, who, having pitched
his camp, was about to waste the territory thereof. But
the Platæans sent ambassadors presently unto him, with
words to this effect:—’Archidamus, and you Lacedæmonians,
you do neither justly, nor worthy yourselves and
ancestors, in making war upon Platæa. For Pausanias
of Lacedæmon, the son of Cleombrotus, having (together
with such Grecians as were content to undergo the danger
of the battle that was fought in this our territory)
delivered all Greece from the slavery of the Persians,
when he offered sacrifice in the market&ndash;place of Platæa
to Jupiter the deliverer, called together all the confederates,
and granted to the Platæans this privilege:
that their city and territory should be free; that none
should make unjust war against them, nor go about to
enslave them; and if any did, the confederates then
present should use their utmost ability to revenge their
quarrel.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These privileges your fathers granted us for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
our valour and zeal in those dangers. But now do you
the clean contrary, for you join with our greatest enemies,
the Thebans, to bring us into subjection. Therefore
calling to witness the gods then sworn by, and the gods
peculiar to your ancestral descent, and our own local
gods, we require you, that you do no damage to the territory
of Platæa, nor violate those oaths; but that you
suffer us to enjoy our liberty in such sort as was allowed
us by Pausanias.’<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>“The Platæans having thus said, Archidamus replied,
and said thus:—’Men of Platæa, if you would do as ye
say, you say what is just. For as Pausanias hath granted
to you, so also be you free; and help to set free the
rest, who having been partakers of the same dangers
then, and being comprised in the same oath with yourselves,
are now brought into subjection by the Athenians.
And this so great preparation and war is only for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
deliverance of them and others: of which if you will
especially participate, keep your oaths; at least (as we
have also advised you formerly) be quiet, and enjoy
your own, in neutrality, receiving both sides in the way
of friendship, neither side in the way of faction. And
these things will content us.’ Thus said Archidamus.
And the ambassadors of Platæa, when they heard him,
returned to the city; and having communicated his
answer to the people, brought word again to Archidamus,
‘That what he had advised was impossible for
them to perform, without leave of the Athenians, in
whose keeping were their wives and children; and that
they feared also for the whole city, lest when the Lacedæmonians
were gone the Athenians should come and
take the custody of it out of their hands; or that the
Thebans, as being comprehended in the oath that they
would admit both parties, should again attempt to surprise
it.’ But Archidamus, to encourage them, made
this answer: ‘Deliver you unto us Lacedæmonians your
city and your houses; show us the bounds of your territory;
give us your trees by tale, and whatsoever else can
be numbered; and depart yourselves, whither you shall
think good, as long as the war lasteth. And when it
shall be ended we will deliver it all unto you again: in
the mean time we will keep these things as deposited, and
will cultivate your ground, and pay you rent for it, as
much as shall suffice for your maintenance.’</p>

<p>“Hereupon the ambassadors went again into the city,
and having consulted with the people, made answer:
‘That they would first acquaint the Athenians with it,
and if they would consent they would then accept the
condition; till then they desired a suspension of arms,
and not to have their territory wasted.’ Upon this he
granted them so many days’ truce as was requisite for
their return, and for so long forbore to waste their territory.
When the Platæan ambassadors were arrived at
Athens, and had advised on the matter with the Athenians,
they returned to the city with this answer: ‘The
Athenians say, that neither in former times, since we
where their confederates, did they ever abandon us to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
injury of any, nor will they now neglect us, but give us
their utmost assistance; and they conjure us, by the oath
of our fathers, not to make any alienation touching the
league.’</p>

<p>“When the ambassadors had made this report, the
Platæans resolved in their councils not to betray the
Athenians, but rather to endure, if it must be, the wasting
of their territory before their eyes, and to suffer
whatsoever misery could befal them; and no more to go
forth, but from the walls to make them this answer:
‘That it was impossible for them to do as the Lacedæmonians
had required.’ When they had answered so,
Archidamus the king first made a protestation to the gods
and heroes of the country, saying thus: ‘All ye gods
and heroes, protectors of the land of Platæa, be witnesses
that we neither invade this territory, wherein our
fathers, after their vows unto you, overcame the Medes,
and which you made propitious for the Grecians to fight
in, unjustly now in the beginning, because they have
first broken the league they had sworn; nor what we
shall further do will be any injury, because though we
have offered many and reasonable conditions, they have
yet been all refused. Assent ye also to the punishment
of the beginners of injury, and to the revenge of those
that bear lawful arms.’</p>

<p>“Having made this protestation to the gods, he made
ready his army for the war. And first having felled
trees, he therewith made a palisado about the town that
none might go out. That done, they raised a mound
against the wall, hoping, with so great an army all at
work at once, to have quickly taken it. And, having
cut down timber in the mountain Cithæron, they built a
frame of timber and wattled it about on either side, to
serve instead of a wall, to keep the earth from falling
too much away, and cast into it stones and earth, and
whatsoever else would serve to fill it up. Seventy days
and nights continually they cast up the mound, dividing
the work between them for rest in such manner, as some
might be carrying, whilst others took their sleep and
food. And they were urged to labour by the Lacedæmonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
officers, who commanded severally the contingents
of the allied cities. The Platæans seeing the
mound to rise, made the frame of a wall with wood,
which, having placed on the wall of the city in the place
where the mound touched, they built it within full of
bricks, taken from the adjoining houses, for that purpose
demolished; the timbers serving to bind them together,
that the building might not be weakened by the height.
The same was also covered with skins and leather, both
to keep the timber from shot of wildfire and those that
wrought from danger. So that the height of the wall
was great on one side, and the mound went up as fast on
the other. The Platæans used also this device; they
broke a hole in their own wall, where the mound joined,
and drew the earth from it into the city. But the Peloponnesians,
when they found it out, rammed clay into
cases made of reeds, which they cast into the cavity,
with intention that the mound should not moulder, and
be carried away like loose earth. The Platæans, excluded
here, gave over that plot, and digging a secret
mine, which they carried under the mound from within
the city by conjecture, fetched away the earth again, and
were a long time undiscovered; so that the earth being
continually carried out below, it was no use to cast fresh
stuff on the mound, which still settled down into the
excavation. Nevertheless, fearing that they should not
be able even thus to hold out, being few against many,
they devised this further; they gave over working at the
high wall against the mound, and beginning at both ends
of it, where the wall was low, built another wall in form
of a crescent, inward to the city, that, if the great wall
were taken, this might resist, and put the enemy to make
another mound, in the continuing of which further inwards
they should have their labour over again, and withal should
be more exposed on either side to missile weapons. And
at the same time that they were raising the mound, the
Peloponnesians brought to the city their engines of
battery; one of which, by help of the mound, they
applied to the high wall, wherewith they much shook it,
and put the Platæans into great fear; and others to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
parts of the wall, which the Platæans broke partly by
casting ropes about them, and partly with great beams,
which being hung in long iron chains by either end upon
two other great beams jetting over, and inclining from
above the wall like two horns, they drew up to them in a
horizontal position, and when the engine was about to
make a blow any where, they let go the chains and let
the beam fall, which, by the violence of its descent, broke
off the head of the battering&ndash;ram.</p>

<p>“After this, the Peloponnesians, seeing their engines
availed not, and thinking it hard to take the city by any
present violence, prepared themselves to draw an enclosure
all around it. But first they thought fit to attempt
it by fire, being no great city, and when the wind should
rise, if they could, to burn it; for there was no way they
did not think on, to have gained it without expense and
long siege. Having therefore brought faggots, they
cast them from the mound into the space between it and
their new wall, which by so many hands was quickly
filled; and then into as much of the rest of the city as
at that distance they could reach; and throwing amongst
them fire, together with brimstone and pitch, kindled
the wood, and raised such a flame, as the like was never
seen before, made by the hand of man. For it has been
known that a forest in the mountains has taken fire<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
spontaneously from the friction of its boughs in a high
wind, and burst into flames. But this fire was a great
one, and the Platæans, that had escaped other mischiefs,
wanted little of being consumed by this; for there was
a large part of the town within which it was impossible
to approach; and if the wind had blown the fire that
way (as the enemy hoped it might) they could never
have escaped. It is also reported that there fell uch
rain then, with great thunder, and that the flame was
extinguished and the danger ceased by that.</p>

<p>“Now the Peloponnesians, when they failed likewise
of this, retaining a part of their army, and dismissing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the rest, enclosed the city about with a wall, dividing
the circumference thereof to the charge of the several
cities. There was a ditch both within and without it,
out of which they made their bricks; and after it was
finished, which was about the rising of Arcturus,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> they
left a guard for one&ndash;half of the wall (for the other was
guarded by the B&oelig;otians), and departed with the rest of
their army, and were dissolved according to their cities.
The Platæans had before this sent their wives and
children and all their unserviceable men to Athens.
The rest were besieged, being in number of the
Platæans themselves four hundred, of Athenians eighty,
and one hundred and ten women to dress their meat.
These were all when the siege was first laid, and not
more, neither free nor bond, in the city. In this manner
were the Platæans besieged.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The blockade continued for about a year and a half,
during which the historian does not advert to it. At the
end of that time, in the winter, <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 428&ndash;7, the garrison,
after deliberation, being pressed by hunger and despairing
of any help from Athens, resolved to abandon the city,
and force a passage through the line of circumvallation.
Half the number took alarm at the seeming rashness of
the attempt, and declined to share it; but about two
hundred and twenty persisted in their resolution. We
now return to the historian’s narrative:—</p>

<p>“As for the wall of the Peloponnesians, it was thus
built; it consisted of a double circle, one towards Platæa,
and another outward, in case of an assault from Athens.
These two walls were distant one from the other about
sixteen feet; and that sixteen feet of space between
them was disposed and built into cabins for the force
that kept the works, which were so joined and continued
one to another, that the whole appeared to be one thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
battlements stood a great tower of the same breadth as
the walls, and stretching across them from the inner to
the outer face, so that there was no passage by the side
of a tower, but through the midst of it. And such
nights as there happened any storm of rain, they used to
quit the battlements of the wall, and to watch under the
towers, as being not far asunder, and covered beside
overhead. Such was the form of the wall wherein the
Peloponnesians kept their watch.</p>

<p>“The Platæans, after they were ready, waiting for a
tempestuous night of wind and rain, and withal moonless,
went out of the city, and were conducted by those
men who had proposed the attempt. And first they
passed the ditch that was about the town, and then came
up close to the wall of the enemy, who through the
darkness could not see them coming, nor hear them for
the clatter of the storm, which drowned the noise of their
approach. And they came on besides at a good distance
one from the other, that they might not be betrayed by
the clashing of their arms; and were but lightly armed,
and not shod but on the left foot, for the more steadiness
in the mud. They came thus to the battlements in one
of the spaces between tower and tower, knowing that
there was now no watch kept there. And first came they
that carried the ladders, and placed them to the wall;
then twelve lightly armed, only with a dagger and a
breast&ndash;plate, went up, led by Ammeas, the son of Coræbus,
who was the first that mounted; and after him
ascended his followers, to each tower six. To these
succeeded others lightly armed, that carried the darts,
for whom they that came after carried targets at their
backs, that they might be the more expedite to get up,
which targets they were to deliver to them when they
came to the enemy. At length, when most of them were
ascended, they were heard by the watchmen that were
in the towers; for one of the Platæans, taking hold of
the battlements, threw down a tile, which made a noise
in the fall, and presently there was an alarm, and the
army ran to the wall, for in the dark and stormy night
they knew not what the danger was. And the Platæans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that were left in the city came forth withal, and assaulted
the wall of the Peloponnesians on the opposite part to
that where their men went over; so that they were all
in a tumult in their several places, and not any of them
that watched durst stir to the aid of the rest, nor were
able to conjecture what had happened. But those three
hundred<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> that were appointed to assist the watch upon
all occasions of need, went without the wall, and made
towards the place of the clamour. They also held up
the fires by which they used to make known the
approach of enemies, towards Thebes. But then the
Platæans likewise held out many other fires from the
wall of the city, which for that purpose they had before
prepared, to confound the meaning of the enemy’s signal&ndash;fires,
and that the Thebans, apprehending the matter
otherwise than it was, might forbear to send help till
their men were over, and had recovered some place of
safety.</p>

<p>“In the mean time those Platæans, which having
scaled the wall first and slain the watch, were now
masters of both the towers, not only guarded the passages
by standing themselves in the entries, but also
applying ladders from the wall to the towers, and conveying
many men to the top, kept the enemies off with
shot both from above and below. In the mean space the
greatest number of them having reared to the wall many
ladders at once, and beaten down the battlements, passed
quite over between the towers, and ever as any of them
got to the other side, they stood still upon the brink of
the ditch, and with arrows and darts kept off those that
came along the wall to hinder the passage of their companions.
And when the rest were over, then last of all,
and with much ado, came they also which were in the
two towers down to the ditch. And by this time the
three hundred, that were to assist the watch, came and
set upon them, and had lights with them; by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
means the Platæans that were on the further brink of
the ditch discerned them the better from out of the
dark, and aimed their arrows and darts at their most
disarmed parts; for, standing in the dark, the light of
the enemy made the Platæans the less discernible: insomuch
as the last of them passed the ditch in time, though
with difficulty and force; for the water in it was frozen
over, though not so hard as to bear, but watery, and such
as when the wind is at east rather than at north; and
the snow which fell that night, together with so great a
wind as there was, had very much increased the water,
which they waded through, with scarce their heads
above. But yet the greatness of the storm was the
principal means of their escape.</p>

<p>“From the ditch the Platæans in troop took the way
towards Thebes, leaving on the right hand the shrine of
the hero Androcrates, both for that they supposed it
would be least suspected that they had taken the road
leading to their enemies; and also because they saw the
Peloponnesians with their lights pursue that way, which,
by Mount Cithæron and the Oakheads, led to Athens;
and for six or seven furlongs the Platæans followed the
road to Thebes; then turning off they took that towards
the mountain leading to Erythræ and Hysiæ, and, having
gotten the hills, escaped through to Athens, being two
hundred and twelve persons out of a greater number: for
some of them returned into the city before the rest went
over, and one of their archers was taken upon the ditch
without. And so the Peloponnesians gave over the pursuit,
and returned to their places. But the Platæans
that were within the city knowing nothing of the event,
and those that turned back having told them that not a
man escaped, as soon as it was day sent a herald to
entreat a truce for the taking up of their dead bodies;
but when they knew the truth, they gave it over. And
thus these men of Platæa passed through the fortification
of their enemies, and were saved.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>A bolder and more fortunate stroke for life and liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
has never been described. How deep must have been
the mortification of those whose courage failed at the
decisive moment, upon learning the brilliant success of
their comrades’ attempt! Dearly did they pay for disgracing
their brave resistance by a single moment of
timidity. Forced at last by famine to yield up the town,
which the besiegers could at any time have taken by
assault, but that they had an ulterior object in wishing to
obtain it by surrender, the only terms they could obtain
were, that they should surrender themselves and their
city to the justice of Sparta, so that none but the guilty
should be punished. Commissioners were sent out to
try them. The only question asked was this: Had they
done any service to the Lacedæmonians or their allies in
the present war? The Platæans requested that instead
of merely answering this question they might reply at
length; and having obtained it, commissioned two
persons to plead their cause. They set forth the
peculiarly hard situation in which this mode of trial, if
such it could be called, placed them; which, setting
aside the justice of their cause, required them to pronounce
their own certain condemnation. They reminded
the hearers of their services in the Persian war,
of the privileges and immunities conferred on them by
Pausanias and the Greeks, and the respect due to their
territory, as the repository of the bones of those who
fell in the great battle which for ever relieved Greece
from the fear of Persia. They urged, that when they
had sought alliance with Sparta, and protection against
Thebes, the Spartans themselves had rejected their
petition, and referred them to Athens; they suggested
skilfully the high reputation of the Spartans for probity,
and dwelt on the disgrace which they would incur, if, in
a cause of such importance, they should commit injustice.
But they pleaded in vain: the character which they
ascribed to the Spartans, if ever deserved, was now deserved
no longer, and their fate was predetermined. The
question, Had they done any good to the Lacedæmonians?
was repeated to them one by one; and as it could not be
answered in the affirmative, they were led off to execution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to the number of 200 Platæans and twenty&ndash;five
Athenians. Nor was this a single instance of barbarity,
for it was the practice of the Spartans to put their
prisoners to death, even the crews of such merchant
ships as they captured; an example too readily followed
by their antagonists. One, and but one, such action
may be cited in modern times, the massacre of the
Turkish prisoners at Jaffa, the most hateful, and save
one perhaps the most hated, of the remorseless actions of
Napoleon. Yet for this there is some shadow of excuse,
however insufficient to justify the deed to modern morals,
in the broken parole of those who were put to death.
To the Greeks such excuse would have been ample; nay,
none such was required. Humanity has made no small
progress, even in the midst of warfare. The town
of Platæa was levelled with the ground by the Thebans.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Similar was the fate, similar, but even more obstinate
and remarkable was the resistance, of Numantia, the last
stronghold of those gallant and generous Celtiberians,
who, after the infamous murder of Viriatus, upheld the
liberties of Spain against Rome. During five successive
years, six Roman officers met with defeats, more or less
signal, under its walls, and peace, twice offered and
concluded by the unsuccessful generals to retrieve their
safety, was as often disowned and violated by the unblushing
perfidy of the senate. The circumstances of
one of these treaties are so creditable to the <i>barbarian</i>
Spaniards, as they were called by the Romans, that we
will go somewhat out of the way to relate them.</p>

<p>The highest estimate of the Numantine force falls
short of 10,000 men. C. Hostilius Mancinus, consul
<span class="smcap">A. U.</span> 615 (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 139), succeeding to the command
of 30,000 men employed in besieging them, found his
army so dispirited by a long train of reverses, that he
judged it best to retire to some distance from the town.
He intended to effect this secretly by a night march, but
the besieged, getting notice of his design, fell upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Roman rear, killed 10,000, it is said, and surrounded the
rest in such a manner that escape was hopeless. Anxious
only for peace and independence, they readily accepted
the terms offered by Mancinus as a ransom for his army.
What these were does not appear, but they were sworn
to by the consul and chief officers. Mancinus, on the
first rumour of his defeat, was recalled to Rome, and
deputies from Numantia accompanied him, to obtain the
ratification of the treaty. But the haughty senate, as
once before in the celebrated surrender at the Caudine
Forks, refused to admit terms humiliating to the dignity
of the republic, though not to profit by the release of
their countrymen. The war was continued; but to
satisfy their notions of equity Mancinus was given up to
the Numantines, a voluntary testimony, to do him
justice, to his own good faith in the transaction. Returning
to Spain with his successor, Furius, he was led
naked to the waist, his hands tied behind him, to the
gates of Numantia. But the Numantines refused to take
vengeance on an innocent man; saying, that the breach
of the public faith could not be expiated by the death of
one person. Let the senate abide by the treaty, or
deliver up those who have escaped under the shelter
of it.</p>

<p>At first perfidy did not seem to prosper. Furius and
his successor Calpurnius Piso made no more progress
than their predecessors, and so high grew the reputation
of the besieged for valour, that no one, Florus says, ever
expected to see the back of a Numantine. At last,
<span class="smcap">A. U.</span> 619, the Romans, weary of the war, and anxious
above all things to bring it to an end, re&ndash;elected to the
office of consul Scipio Æmilianus, celebrated as the final
conqueror and destroyer of Carthage, and expressly
assigned Spain to him as his province, instead of suffering
the two consuls to draw lots for the choice of provinces,
as was the usual course. Scipio’s first care was
to restore discipline in his army, which he found corrupted
by luxury. With this view he expelled all the
idle and profligate followers of the camp; practised his
troops in all military exercises, inured them to exposure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and fatigue, and when he thought the ancient tone of
Roman discipline was restored, led them, not against the
formidable Numantines, but against a neighbouring
people. Obtaining a trifling advantage over a party of
the former who had attacked his foragers, he refused to
prosecute it, thinking it enough that the reputed invincibility
of the Numantines was disproved. On this
occasion, says Plutarch, the Numantines being reproached
on their return to the city, for retiring before an enemy
whom they had so often beaten, replied, “The Romans
might indeed be the same sheep, but they had gotten a
new shepherd.”</p>

<p>In the ensuing winter, his army being increased to
60,000 men, Scipio determined to invest the town. Regardless
of the disproportion of force, the besieged often
offered battle, which he refused, preferring the slow
work of famine to encountering the desperation of veteran
and approved soldiers. With this view he proceeded to
draw lines of circumvallation round the town; and it is
said by Appian, that he was the first general who ever
took that method of reducing a place, the garrison of
which did not decline a battle in the open field. The
town was about three miles in compass, and lay on the
slope of a hill, at the foot of which ran the river Durius,
now called the Douro. Around it Scipio traced a
double ditch, six miles in circuit, with a rampart eight
feet thick and ten feet high, not including a parapet
strengthened by towers at intervals of 125 feet. The
river, where it intersected the works, was effectually
blocked up by chains and booms. The besieged often
endeavoured to check the progress of the Romans, but
the superiority of numbers, aided by restored discipline,
was too much for them.</p>

<p>The blockade had lasted six months, and the Numantines
were hard pressed by famine, before they condescended
to inquire whether, if they surrendered, they
would meet with honourable treatment. An unconditional
surrender was required. Urged even to desperation,
they still refused to consign themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
slavery or mutilation, for the latter often was the fate of
those whose strength and valour the Romans had found
reason to respect. Rather than submit to such a fate,
they consumed their arms and effects, and houses, in one
general conflagration, and dying by the sword, or poison,
or fire, left the victor nothing of Numantia to adorn his
triumph but the name.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Such was the unworthy fate of a city which had
spared more Roman soldiers than itself could muster
armed men. “Most brave,” says the historian, “and,
in my opinion, most happy in its very misfortunes! It
asserted faithfully the cause of its allies; alone it resisted,
for how long a time, a nation armed with the strength
of the whole world.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is an easy thing to write rhetorical
flourishes, and very often mischievous as well as
easy. Had Florus ever undergone one tithe of the
sufferings inflicted on the miserable Numantines, we
might possibly not have heard of their supreme felicity.
It might have done him some good by quickening his
moral sense, and might have prevented his beginning the
next chapter with the assertion, that “hitherto the Roman
people was excellent, pious, holy.” Verily, such
history as this is a profitable study!</p>

</div></div>

<p>In reading of such sieges as these, one of the first
things which strikes a reader not familiar with ancient
warfare, is the extreme rudeness of the methods employed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and the vast expense of time and labour; yet,
compared with earlier times, even the siege of Platæa is
of no extraordinary duration. Not to go back to the ten&ndash;year
sieges of Troy and Eira, the Messenians in Ithome
held out against the Spartans during nine years; and, in
the Peloponnesian war itself, Potidæa resisted for a still
longer period than Platæa: such was the patience of a
besieging army in waiting for the slow operation of
hunger, or for some fortunate chance which, as at Eira,
might give possession of the town at an unguarded moment.
Before the battering&ndash;ram was invented, force
could avail little against solid walls; and men soon
found out, with Wamba, in Ivanhoe, that their hands
were little fitted to make mammocks of stone and mortar.
A well&ndash;conducted escalade might succeed; a skilful
stratagem might deceive the vigilance of the garrison;
an ingenious general might devise some method of attack
which should render walls useless, as in the attempt to
burn out the Platæans, and might derive some advantage
from natural facilities, or even from natural obstacles, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
as to convert what the besieged most trusted in into the
means of their destruction; but to overthrow or pass the
walls by violence was commonly beyond his power. But
the introduction of the ram worked a material change in
the relative strength of the besiegers and besieged, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
few walls could be found strong enough to bear the repeated
application of its powerful shocks. Next in
importance to the ram were those huge moving towers
which overtopped walls, and were provided with drawbridges,
by means of which, the battlements being previously
cleared of their defenders by missile weapons
from above, a body of troops might at once be thrown
upon them.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill025" id="ill025">ill025</a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Moveable towers, from Pompeii, vol. i. p. 80.</p>
</div></div>

<p>No material alteration in the methods of attack took
place till the discovery of gunpowder gave force enough
to projectiles to batter down the strongest walls, without
exposing men and machinery to the hazard of close
approach. The only improvements which did take place
consisted in supplying means by which the assailants
might approach with less danger to the foot of the walls,
and there apply the powerful ram, or, in some instances,
resort to mining.</p>

<p>In illustration of these remarks we may notice, very
shortly, two of the most remarkable sieges in ancient history,
those of Tyre and Syracuse, both resolutely sustained,
both finally successful, both carried on by rich and powerful
nations who commanded every thing that the best
skill of the engineer, or the labour of numbers, could
effect. The first was undertaken by Alexander soon after
the battle of Issus, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 333. From past ages the
Ph&oelig;nicians had been celebrated among Asiatics for their
maritime skill, and Tyre was the most powerful of the
Ph&oelig;nician cities. Trusting in their naval strength to
obviate blockade and famine, and in the height of their
walls and strength of their situation to repel violence,
the Tyrians refused admission to Alexander, remaining
faithful to their engagements with Persia. Too weak at
sea to assault the walls from his fleet, Alexander had no
resource but to carry out a mole to the island. Near the
walls there were three fathoms of water, which shoaled
gradually to the shore. The mole was built of stone,
heaped up, we may suppose, of rough uncemented blocks,
like the Plymouth breakwater, and strengthened with
piles; and the top was constructed entirely, or in part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of wood. At first it proceeded with despatch, but more
slowly and more difficultly as it approached the walls,
from which the besieged annoyed the workmen with
missiles, and, at the same time, constantly harassed them
from the sea. To protect themselves from these attacks
the Macedonians built on the verge of the mole two high
towers, armed with engines, and covered with raw hides
as defence against darts armed with fire. These the
Tyrians destroyed by a peculiarly constructed fire&ndash;ship.
Having filled a large transport with dry twigs and combustible
matter, they fixed two masts in the prow,
heaped faggots high around them, and added pitch, sulphur,
and every thing that was proper to feed the flames.
To each mast they fastened two yard&ndash;arms, from the ends
of which two cauldrons were suspended, filled with combustibles.
The ballast they moved entirely to the stern,
to raise her head as high out of the water as possible.
Thus prepared, they took advantage of a favourable wind
to run her up on the mole, and set fire to her, the crew
escaping by swimming; and both mole and towers were
speedily involved in the conflagration. Meanwhile the
Tyrians, from ships and boats, assisted in the ruin, destroyed
the piles, and burnt those engines which would
otherwise have escaped the flames. The work therefore
had to be recommenced, and it was rebuilt on a larger
scale.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>While this labour was proceeding, Alexander’s fleet
was reinforced in consequence of the submission of the
Cypriots and Sidonians, to an extent which enabled him
to command the sea, and compelled the Tyrians to block
up the mouths of their harbours. Numerous mechanics
were employed in constructing military engines; some
of which were placed on board the largest ships of the
fleet, and the rest were mounted on the mole. The
Tyrians, still to have the advantage of height, built
wooden towers upon their walls facing the mole. This
would seem scarcely necessary if we credit Arrian’s assertion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that the city wall in that part was 150 feet
high;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but it gives us a scale for measuring the altitude
of Alexander’s towers, which we may assume, from this
precaution, to have been as great or greater. On the
side to the sea they cast fiery darts into the attacking
ships, and showers of stones, which not only did much
harm in their fall, but raised a bank which made it impossible
to get close up to the walls. The Macedonians
therefore were obliged to clear away these impediments;
a work in itself of difficulty and labour, increased by the
resolution of the Tyrians, who openly, by sending armed
ships, and secretly, by means of divers, cut adrift from
their moorings the vessels employed on this service.
The Macedonians frustrated this method of defence by
using chains instead of cables for mooring, and succeeded
at last in clearing away the bank, and getting access to
the wall. On the north side, and that next the mole, it
resisted their efforts; but a breach was effected on the
south side by battering from the ships, and an assault
was made, but without success. On the third day afterwards,
the breach being enlarged, a second assault was
made under Alexander in person, and the town was
carried. Eight thousand Tyrians were slain, and thirty
thousand persons, natives and strangers, are said to have
been sold for slaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The most remarkable feature of this siege is the battering
in breach from the shipping, which would seem a
most unstable base for the cumbrous and weighty engines
which must have been used. It may be wished that
Arrian had been more explicit on this subject, but he has
given no explanation of the means employed. Quintus
Curtius relates far greater wonders, and in the same
proportion is less worthy of belief than the plain and
unassuming statement of Arrian, which we have followed.</p>

<p>The siege of Syracuse, undertaken by the Romans
under command of Marcus Claudius Marcellus, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 213,
is rendered most remarkable by the interposition of the
celebrated geometrician Archimedes. Many extraordinary
stories are told of the wonderful things done by
him, which, if they rested only on the authority of Plutarch,
and other compilers of stories, it would be the
natural and simple course to reject; but some of the
most singular are affirmed by Polybius, almost a contemporary,
well skilled in war, and of undoubted credit
for honesty and discernment; and one point, of which
Polybius makes no mention, has been ascertained to be
practicable by modern experiment. It is to be regretted
that but a fragment of his account remains.</p>

<p>Syracuse was divided into five districts, the little
island of Ortygia, Acradina, Tycha, Neapolis, and
Epipolæ. Marcellus directed his attack against Acradina,
which adjoined the sea, with fifty quinqueremes, or
vessels with five banks of oars, well filled with soldiers
armed with all kinds of missile weapons to clear the
walls. He had also eight ships fitted out in a peculiar
way with machines called <i>sambucæ</i>, from some fancied
resemblance to a harp. They where thus prepared: two
ships were lashed together, the oars being taken from
the two adjoining sides, so as to form, as it were, one
large double&ndash;keeled vessel, affording a broad and stable
base. A ladder was then made, four feet broad, of the
necessary height, protected at the sides and above with
gratings and hides, so as to form a sort of covered way to
the very summit of the walls. It was then so placed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the foot at the stern, the head projecting beyond the
prow, that it could be raised by ropes run through pulleys
at the mast&ndash;heads. At the top was a platform large
enough to contain four men, with high sides which turned
on hinges, and which being let down served as bridges
to connect the ladder with the walls of the besieged town.</p>

<p>At the request of Hiero, king of Syracuse, Archimedes
had in past years constructed a great number of
machines for casting stones and darts; with which the
walls were so well supplied, that the Romans were defeated
in every attempt to approach: Marcellus ran his
ships by night beneath the walls, hoping to be within the
range of these destructive engines. Here, however, he
was anticipated, for Archimedes had hollowed chambers
in the walls themselves, with narrow openings, like the
embrasures of a Gothic castle, from which archery, and
the smaller sorts of missile engines, were directed against
the Roman ships with destructive effect. Against the
sambucæ he had contrived machines, from which long beams
or yards projected, when in use, far beyond the
walls. These were heavily weighted with stone or
metal to the extent of not less than ten talents, or 1250
pounds. A rapid circular motion being then given to
the beam by machinery within the walls, this weighted
lever was dashed against the ladder with such force as
generally to break it, while the ship itself was exposed
to considerable danger. This story not being good
enough for Plutarch, he has told us, that when the sambuca
was a good way off the walls, a stone ten talents
weight was thrown into it, and then a second, and third,
which destroyed the vessel; and in consequence considerable
ridicule has been thrown on the tale. As told by
Polybius it seems little open to objection. Weights, not
of half a ton, but several tons, are constantly to be seen
on our wharfs suspended on cranes, at a considerable
distance from a centre of motion. Add to one of these
the machinery requisite to give a rapid circular motion
to the projecting arm thus laden, and we have the engine
of Archimedes, as described by Polybius. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
geometrician had also fitted out powerful cranes, with
hooks and chains, by which he could lift a ship almost
out of the water. When it was raised to the greatest
practicable height, the chain was slipped, and the vessel
usually was either upset by the fall, or plunged so deep
as to fill with water. Marcellus is reported to have observed
(it must have been a forced joke), that Archimedes
used his ships for cups to draw water in. Finally
he was obliged to abandon the attack by sea. Appius
Claudius, who conducted the siege by land, fared no better:
and it was resolved at last to give up all hopes of
succeeding by force, and trust to the slow operation of
blockade. “Thus,” says Polybius, “one man, and one
art rightly prepared,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is for some matters a mighty and
a wonderful thing; for the Romans, having such power
by land and sea, take away but one old man of Syracuse,
might have expected immediately to capture the city;
but while Archimedes was there, they dared not even to
attack it in that manner against which he was capable of
defending it.”</p>

<p>It is also said that Archimedes set the Roman ships
on fire by means of burning mirrors, composed of a combination
of plane mirrors, adjusted so as to reflect all the
incident rays of light to the same point. The possibility
of this has several times been the subject of inquiry to
modern philosophers. Kircher took so much interest in
the subject, that he went to Syracuse expressly to inquire
into the probable position of Marcellus’s fleet, and he
arrived at the conclusion, that it might have been within
thirty yards of the walls. Buffon’s experiments, made
as well as those of Archimedes with a combination of
plane mirrors, are conclusive as to the facility of setting
tarred fir plank on fire at a distance of one hundred and
fifty feet, and the possibility of doing it at considerably
greater distances. Similar planks, and even more combustible
materials, were precisely what Archimedes had to
deal with. He is said to have operated in this way at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
distance of a bow&ndash;shot, in which there may very probably
be exaggeration.</p>

<p>The sequel of the siege contains no matter of interest.
Syracuse was taken by surprise through the negligence
of the guard, and Archimedes is said to have been slain
by a soldier, as he was deeply intent on the solution of a
problem.</p>

<p>Lines of circumvallation continued long to be the
principal means employed by the Romans in the reduction
of strong places. Even the inventive genius of
Cæsar does not appear to have devised the means of dispensing
with this tedious and most laborious process. In
his Gallic wars he had frequent recourse to it, though
the Gallic fortifications, it might be thought, could not be
of the most formidable description; and the siege of
Alesia furnishes one of the most remarkable instances of
it on record. The town stood on an eminence, surrounded
on three sides by hills of equal height, at a
moderate distance: in front extended a plain, three
miles in length. Round the foot of this eminence he
dug a trench, twenty feet in width; and again, at an
interval of 400 feet, two more, of which the inner one
was filled with water: behind them he built a rampart
twelve feet high, crowned with battlements, and
strengthened with towers at intervals of eighty feet; and,
more effectually to confine the besieged, and enable a
smaller force to guard the works, the space between
them and the inner ditch was filled with three distinct
rows of obstacles. The first consisted of a sort of abattis,
made with large branches of trees, with the ends squared
and sharpened, set firmly in the earth (<i>cippi</i>). The
next were called lilies (<i>lilia</i>), from their resemblance to
the calix of that flower, with its upright pistil: these
were circular cup&ndash;shaped cavities, three feet deep, with a
sharpened stake in the centre, projecting about four
inches above ground, and covered over with brushwood
to deceive assailants. Still nearer to the town iron hooks
(<i>stimuli</i>, like the Scottish <i>calthrop</i>, often used with effect
against the English cavalry) were scattered, to lacerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the feet of the advancing enemy. The whole circuit of
these works was fourteen miles, and a similar series protected
the troops from attack from without.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>To come down to a period more interesting to modern
readers, we find, in the middle ages, the same principles
of operation followed, but in a ruder way, since neither
men, nor money, nor science were so abundant among
the nations who established kingdoms on the ruins of the
western empire, as among the Romans; and, moreover,
the turbulent independence of a feudal army, whose
term of service was usually limited to a certain time, was
unfitted for the severe labour, or the patient and continued
watching, which the Roman legionaries cheerfully
underwent. Still such skill as our ancestors of the
middle ages had was borrowed from the Romans; they
employed the same species of machines, towers, rams,
and moveable galleries called cats, and the same or similar
projectile engines, mentioned under the same names
of catapultæ, onagri, scorpiones, &amp;c., in the Latin authors
of the eleventh and twelfth centuries; and mangonels,
trebuchets, war&ndash;wolfs, &amp;c. in the vernacular tongue.
The first defence of a castle or city was usually a strong
wooden palisade called the barriers; and at these many of
the most obstinate contests and remarkable feats of arms
recorded by Froissart and other chroniclers of the times
took place. These being carried, the next step was to
level the ground, drain or fill up the ditch, and prepare
for bringing up the battering&ndash;rams or towers, or scaling&ndash;ladders,
if it were thought fit to attempt an escalade.
In the first crusade the headlong valour of the Christian
knights endeavoured in vain to overleap the walls
or force the gates of Jerusalem: time was required to
construct two moving towers, and on the difficulty of
procuring wood the fiction of the enchanted forest of
Armida, in Tasso’s poem, is founded. The leader of
the Genoese, one of the great maritime states of Italy,
was the architect.</p>

<p class="pr4">(xviii. 98&ndash;100.)</p>

<p class="p1">We originally meant only to introduce Tasso’s description
of the towers, and have been led on to protract
the quotation to far greater length, from finding not
only so lively, but there is all reason to believe so
accurate, a description, making allowance for a little
poetical exaggeration, of the mode of combat then in use.
The poet has at least the merit of being true to the facts
related by the historians. Two towers were constructed,
one of which, intrusted to the charge of Raymond, Count
of Toulouse, was burnt by the besieged; the other,
directed by Godfrey in person, was brought safely up to
the walls. Large beams were applied to prevent its
close approach, as described by the poet, and these being
cut away, were taken possession of, and proved very
serviceable to the crusaders. The walls were cleared,
not only by archery, but by a much less warlike and
romantic device. The wind blowing into the town, the
assailants set on fire a mattress stuffed with silk (<i>culcitram
bombyce plenam</i>), and bags of straw, so that “they who
were appointed to defend the wall, unable to open eyes
or mouth, besotted and bewildered with the eddies of the
smoky darkness, deserted their post. Which being
known, the general with all haste commanded the beams
which they had captured from the enemy to be brought
up, and one end resting on the machine, the other on
the wall, he ordered the moveable side of the tower to
be let down; which being supported on them, served in
the place of a bridge of suitable strength.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This, it
must be confessed, is a less romantic way of gaining
entrance than fighting hand to hand with Solyman: but
it is true, for the valour and personal prowess of Godfrey
of Bouillon were unsurpassed, and there is no reason to
suspect that flattering historians have perverted the fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that Godfrey, noblest of the crossed chiefs in character
as in station, was the third man to enter that holy city,
for the delivery of which he longed so ardently, and had
sacrificed so much. Two brothers named Letold and
Engelbert, otherwise unknown to fame, were the first
who won their way to these contested walls.</p>

<p>For reasons above given the strong fortresses of feudal
pride were more frequently carried by a sudden and
vigorous attack, than by the tedious and expensive process
of regular siege. Of such attacks some remarkable
instances occur in the wars between England and
Scotland, which at some future period we may perhaps
notice; at present it is more to our purpose to quote
from the graphic pages of Froissart this short passage,
which is so completely ancient in character that change
the names and it might pass for the act of a Roman
army:—</p>

<p>“The Englysshemen, that had lyen long before the
Ryoll<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> more than nyne weekes, had made in the mean
space two belfroys of grete tymbre, with four stages,
every belfroy upon foure grete whelys, and the sydes
toward the towne were covered with cure boly,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> to
defend them fro fyre and fro shotte; and into every
stage there were poynted a C archers: by strength of
men these two belfroys were brought to the walles of
the towne, for they had so filled the dykes, that they
might well be brought just to the walles; the archers in
these stages shotte so holly togyder, that none durst apere
at their defence, without they were well pavysshed,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
between these two belfroys there were a CC men with pic&ndash;axes
to mine the walles, and so they brake through the
walles. * * * When sir Agous de Ban, who was captain
within, knewe that the people of the towne wolde yelde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
up, he went into the castell with his companye of soudyers,
and whyle they of the towne were entretyng he
conveyed out of the towne gret quantyte of wyne and
other provisyon, and then closed the castell gates, and
sayd how he wolde not yeld up so sone. Then the erle
(of Derby) entred into the towne and layde siege round
about the castell as nere as he mighte, and rered up all
his engynes, the which caste nyght and day agaynst the
walles, but they dyd lytell hurt, the walles were so
strong of harde stone; it was sayd that of olde tyme it
had been wrought by the handes of the Sarasyns, who
made their warkes so strongly that ther is none such
now a dayes. When the erle sawe that he colde do no
good with his engynes, he caused theym to cease; then
he called to hym his myners, to thyntent that they shuld
make a myne under alle the walles, the whiche was nat
sone made.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In the time of Froissart the invention of gunpowder
had already begun to work a change in the art of war:
still, then and for some time afterwards, the imperfection
of the artillery in use rendered them of little real service.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Usually of immense and unwieldy size and
weight, the difficulty of transporting them from place to
place was extreme, and they could not be fired more
than three or four times in the day, at great expense and
with uncertain execution. Even so late as the siege of
Magdeburg, in 1631, it is said that 1550 cannon shots
where fired against one wall with but little effect. But
as the art of gunnery advanced, the battering train was
found to be an overmatch for the strongest fortresses that
had yet been constructed, and a new system of fortification
came gradually into use. Low bastions and curtains
took place of the lofty towers and walls of former
castles; and still the advantage is so entirely transferred
from the besieged to the besiegers, that the termination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of a siege pursued according to the rules of art is
reduced almost to certainty as to the time and method
of its issue. This has diminished the interest of modern
sieges, by making ultimate capture almost a certainty,
and rendering it the interest of the garrison rather to
make terms while they have something to give up, than
to hold out to those extremes of difficulty and distress,
of which ancient history abounds in striking examples.
It has also rendered both the attack and defence matters
more of combination and science, and less of individual
gallantry. There is, however, one war in the transition
stage, as it were, from ancient to modern tactics, distinguished
especially by the number and length of its
sieges, and by the constancy and desperate valour shown
by the beleaguered party in every instance. Even were
we indifferent to the parties, the narrations would in
themselves be deeply interesting, but the nobleness of
their cause renders the sufferings of the brave defenders
doubly affecting—their triumphs doubly glorious. The
reader will readily conclude that we refer to the desperate
struggle of the Netherlands for civil and religious
liberty against the mighty despotism of Spain. Three
sieges which occurred in this war are especially worthy
of the reader’s attention, those of Leyden, Haarlem, and
Ostend. That of Leyden has been already noticed in
the first volume; and after some hesitation we have
selected the siege of Ostend for relation here, as being
more full of incident, not of interest, than that of Haarlem.
We give it from the contemporary historian,
Bentivoglio:—</p>

<p>“We will now come to the siege of Ostend, which,
being one of the most memorable of this our age, doth
certainly challenge, that, as much brevity and diligence
as may be being joyned together, it be duly considered
and represented with all clearness. It was above three
years before it was brought to an end; and it was almost
as uncertain at the last day as at the first to which side
the victory did incline. The besieged never wanted fresh
succours by sea, nor did the besiegers at any time cease
advancing by land. Infinite were the batteries, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
assaults infinite; so many were the mines, and so obstinate
the countermines, as it may be almost affirmed as
much work was done under ground as above ground.
New names were to be found for new engines. There
was a perpetual dispute between the sea and land: the
works on the latter could not operate so much as the
mines made by the former did destroy. Great store of
blood ran every where, and men were readier to lose
it than to preserve it, till such time as the besieged
wanting ground, and rather what to defend than defence,
they were at last forced to forego that little spot of
ground which was left them, and to yield.</p>

<p>“Ostend stands upon the sea&ndash;shore, and in the midst
of a marish ground, and of divers channels which come
from the continent; but it is chiefly environed almost
on all sides by two of the greatest of them,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> by which
the sea enters into the land, and grows so high when it
is full sea, as you would rather think the town were
buried than situated in the sea. In former times it was
an open place, and served rather for a habitation for
shepheards than for soldiers. But the importancy of
the seat being afterwards considered, the houses were
inclosed with a platform instead of a wall, and from time
to time the line was so flank round about it, as it proved
to be one of the strongest towns of all the province of
Flanders. It is divided into two parts, which are called the
old town and the new. The former, which is the lesser,
stands towards the sea; the latter and greater lies
towards the land. The old town is fenced from the
fury of the sea by great piles of wood driven into the
ground, and joined together for the defence of that part,
and there the waves sufficiently supply the part of a
ditch. The channels may be said to do the like on the
sides; and, especially at full sea, of channels they
become havens, being then capable of any kind of
vessels, and by them at all times the middle size of barks
enter into the ditches, and from the ditches in diverse
parts into the town itself; to boot, with the chief wellflanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
line on the outside of the ditch, towards the land
side is a strada coperta raised, which is so well furnished
with new flanks, and with a new ditch, as this outward
fortification doth hardly give way to any of the inward
ones. The town is but of a small compass, and is
ennobled rather by its situation and fortifications than by
any splendour either of inhabitants or houses. The
United Provinces caused it to be very carefully kept at
this time, wherefore it was largely provided of men,
artillery, ammunition, and of whatsoever else was necessary
for the defence thereof. In this condition was the
town when the Archduke resolved to sit down before it.”</p>

<p>On the east of the town there was a detached fort
called St. Alberto, on the west another called Bredene,
both which had been abandoned by the garrison. These
were occupied by the besieging army, which proceeded
to surround Ostend on the landward with a chain of
works, not without sharp fighting, for the governor, Sir
Francis Vere, had raised redoubts in front of his fortifications,
and hotly contested every inch of ground.
It seemed also necessary to cut off the communication
with the sea, and with this view a bank was run out on
the eastern side from St. Alberto to prevent barks from
entering by the channel on that quarter. But it was also
expedient to block up the channel on the side of Bredene,
and in doing this greater difficulties were to be overcome.</p>

<p>The siege began in the summer of 1601, and the
autumn had been consumed in these works, when,
towards the end of December, a terrible storm at sea so
shattered the town, that the inhabitants, despairing to
resist an assault, began to parley; but their spirits were
recruited, and the negotiations broken off by a seasonable
reinforcement both of men and all manner of provisions.
The Archduke, being thus deluded of his hopes, gave
order that a battery should be raised on the side of St.
Alberto, which played so furiously upon the sea bulwark,
that a practicable breach was soon made, and an assault
ordered. To divert the enemy, directions were given
that Count Bucquoy, who commanded at Bredene,
should pass the channel there, and fall with his men on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the wall where it was beaten down, and that upon the
land side there should be alarms given every where.
“When they came to the assault the assailants behaved
themselves gallantly, and used all means to get upon the
wall; and though many of them fell down dead and
wounded, and that the horror of night, which already
came on, made their dangers the more terrible, yet did
it serve rather to set the Catholics on fire, than to make
them cool in their fight. But there appeared no less
resoluteness of resistance in those within: for opposing
themselves valiantly on all sides, and being very well
able to do it, as having so many men, and such store of
all other provisions, they stoutly did defend themselves
on all sides. Upon the coming on of night they had set
up many lights in divers parts of the town, whereby they
the better maintained the places assigned to them, did
with more security hit those that assailed them, and
came the better to where their help was required. They
also soon discerned that they were all false alarms that
were given without, and that the true assault was made
only in one place. To this was added, that Count
Bucquoy, not finding the water of the aforesaid channel
so low as he believed, he could by no means pass over
them. Yet the Catholics did for a long time continue
their assault, but the defendants’ advantages still increasing,
the assailants were at last forced to give over
with great loss; for there were above six hundred slain
and wounded. Nor did those within let slip the occasion
of prejudicing yet more the Catholics as they
retreated: for plucking up some of their sluices, by
which they both received the sea&ndash;water into their ditches
and let it out again, they turned the water with such
violence into the channel, which the Catholics had
passed over before they came to the assault, and which
they were to pass over again in their retreat, as many of
them were unfortunately drowned.”</p>

<p>The year 1602 set in with such severe cold that the
Archduke was advised to abandon the siege. But he
would not be persuaded thereto, thinking the King’s honour
and his own engaged in its success. He ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
therefore a great platform to be raised in the quarter of
St. Alberto, which might command the town as much as
possible, and gave new orders that Bucquoy should advance,
with all possible speed, the great bank which was
designed to obstruct the channel of Bredene. Having
given these orders, he retired to Ghent, and left the
campmaster, John di Rivas, in command of the siege,
who employed himself diligently in forwarding these important
works. “To the first and largest foundation,
which was well incorporated with wet sand and other
condense matter, others of the like sort were added, till
the dyke was grown to the height it ought to be; and
the breadth thereof was very extraordinary great. To
boot with the ordinary plain thereof, upon which two
great cannons might stand abreast, there was a great parapet
raised in it against the town to shelter the soldier;
and which, being in divers places furnished with artillery,
did greatly endamage the enemy likewise on that
side. This work was made in a sandy and low situation,
and whither the sea at full tide came; so as it cannot be
said with how much expense, labour, and loss of blood,
this work was advanced.” Still the town continued to
receive succours as plentifully as ever, and the works
proceeded so slowly from without, that the hopes of
bringing the siege to a happy end did daily rather decrease
than increase. Yet Rivas was very diligent in
discharging his duty; the platform was completed and
mounted with cannon, and the besieged were driven
from some of their outer works: these were then furnished
with artillery, which he turned against the fortifications
which sheltered the town on that side.</p>

<p>“Some progress was likewise daily made on Bredene’s
side in the advancing the great dyke. Bucquoy
had the chief charge thereof, and it was called by his
name. And he used all possible diligence to infest the
town and the entrance of the channel on that side. But
there appeared no less vigilancy in the besieged; their
courage abounded, according as the town did abound
with all sorts of provisions. There was hardly any one
day in which they did not sally out; nor did the besiegers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
do any thing which cost not much labour and
blood. The platform was made chiefly of bavins and
other wood, and the great dyke was composed of the
like materials. Two furious batteries were therefore
levelled from the town, with artificial fire&ndash;balls against
these two works, to set them on fire, and indamage
them by that means. Nor did they fail in their design:
for by long battery they at last took fire, and were
thereby so torn and spoiled, as it cost much time and the
death of many men to remake them. Nor was the enemies’
loss less either in number or quality.</p>

<p>“Pompeio Torgone, a famous engineer, was at this
time come from Italy to Flanders, drawn thither by the
fame of this siege. He had a very ready wit, which
made him apt for inventions in his calling; but having
never till then passed from the theory to the practical
part in military affairs, it was soon seen that many of his
imaginations did not, upon trial, prove such as in appearance
they promised to be. He began to build a castle
of wood upon boats fastened together. The castle was
round, high, and large proportionably. On the top
thereof it was capable of six great pieces of artillery on
one side, and on the other side there was place enough
for those soldiers who were to attend them. Torgone
intended to bring this machine into the mouth of the
channel, and to firm it there, where succour was brought
into Ostend, hoping hereby to keep the town from relief.
But this could not so soon be done, but that it was preceded
by the other work of drawing the great dyke to
the same channel, whereupon to raise afterwards a fort,
by which that passage might be so much the more impeded.
To accelerate this work likewise, Torgone bethought
himself of other engines, by which that so great
quantity of materials, whereof the dyke was made, might
the more easily be brought to employment. The said
materials being put together in manner as they ought to
be, he put a certain number of little barrels under the
hollow of the middle thereof, and on the sides, by which
at full sea the engines floated, and were afterwards
brought by cranes to joyn with the dyke in that part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
where the work was continued on. These engines were
called flotes. But such was the tempest of the enemies’
cannon&ndash;shot, which incessantly fell upon them, when
they rested upon the sand; and then again they were so
prejudiced by the sea&ndash;storms, as oft&ndash;times the work of
many days was destroyed in a few hours. And really it
was a pitiful case to see how much blood was there shed,
and how little the meaner sort of people who were employed
therein did out of a desire of gain value it.”</p>

<p>This was the condition of Ostend when the Archduke
bethought himself to give the care of the siege to the
Marquis Spinola. Great certainly was the honour of
such an employment, yet there seemed so little prospect
of success that Spinola hesitated for some time; but,
finally, being persuaded there was more of hope than
fear in the offer that was made him, he resolved cheerfully
to accept it.</p>

<p>“The first thing the Marquis did was to make great
store of provision of all such materials as were necessary,
as well for the work of the great dyke on Bredene’s
side, as for the other works which were to be
made on the side of St. Alberto, on which side the town
was chiefly intended to be straitened and forced: the
ground over against it was all sandy, and full of several
channels and little rivulets, besides those two greater
channels which fell into the sea, as you have often heard.
The same sea likewise, at the flood, did so whirl about
every place thereabouts, as ground was not any where to
be found to make trenches, which were therefore to be
supplied with the above said materials. These were
chiefly brought by the flotes invented by Torgone; and
though the great dyke did daily advance, yet it was
known that such a work would prove too long and too
uncertain. The hope of keeping out succour growing
there every day less and less, Spinola bent all his endeavours
to take the town by force. We told you before
that all vessels were hindered from coming into the lesser
channel, on St. Alberto’s side, which falls there into the
sea by a fort. Yet the channel itself was of great advantage
to the enemy on that side, for it served for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
great ditch to their counterscarp, which was strong of
itself, and yet made stronger by many flanks by which
it was defended. Before the Catholics could come to
assault the counterscarp, they must first pass over the
channel, which was so hard to do with safety or shelter
in any place thereof, as it was evidently seen that many
of them must perish, being exposed to be injured by the
enemy. The oppugnation was led on, on four sides,
from St. Alberto’s quarter. The Germans wrought
nearer the sea; then followed the Spaniards; after them
the Italians; and on the outmost side, more towards
land, the Walloons and Burgonians. Great was the fervency
of all these nations; and such a contention there
was among them in striving which of them should most
advance the works, as the soldiers’ emulation seemed
rather a contest between enemies than between rivals.
The channel was narrower and more shallow where the
Burgonians and Walloons wrought. They were therefore
the first that passed over it, and afterwards the other
nations did the like. To pass over it, a great quantity of
the aforesaid materials were thrown into every part
thereof, where the aforesaid nations wrought. Those
materials were reduced to dykes or banks, upon which
the soldiers advanced towards the town. But very many
of them were slain and wounded. For the defendants,
with their hail of musquet&ndash;shot and tempest of greater
artillery, charged with little bullets and murdering shot
in great quantity, and oft&ndash;time with artificial fire, made
the Catholics’ work on all sides very bloody. The
soldiers, that they might go the best sheltered that they
could, invented many fences: some consisted of gabions
filled with earth, well joined and fastened together;
others of long bavins, which stood upright, and stood so
thick as they were musket proof; and others, of several
forms, made of the aforesaid materials. Torgone invented
likewise a great cart, from which a bridge made of
cloth and cords might unexpectedly be thrown over the
channel, and so the enemies’ defences might the easier
be assaulted. The cart stood upon four very high
wheels; and upon the fore&ndash;part thereof rose up, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
were, the mast of a ship, which served chiefly to let
down and to take up the bridge. But the whole
bulk proved to be of so cumbersome a greatness, and so
hard to be managed, that, before it was undertaken, it
was known it could work no effect. The aforesaid fences
were wrought where the artillery of the town could not
reach; and, at the flowing of the sea, they were brought
upon the floats, to the places where they were made use
of. Great was the mortality likewise of those that
wrought here; the enemy making usually such havock
of them with their muskets, artillery, and sallies, as oft&ndash;times
hardly one of them could be saved. But money
still got new men, and oft&ndash;times the soldiers themselves
wrought. Nor was Spinola wanting in being in all
places at all times, and in exposing himself as well as
any of the rest to all labour and danger; encouraging
some, rewarding others, and behaving himself so, as his
imitating, without any manner of respect unto himself,
the most hazardous works of others, made the rest the
more ready to imitate his.</p>

<p>“When each nation had passed the channel, each of
them began with like emulation to force the ravelins and
half&ndash;moons which sheltered the counterscarp. And the
Walloons and Burgonians, by reason of their quarter,
were the first that did it, but with much effusion of blood,
even of the noblest amongst them; for amongst the rest,
Catris, a Walloon campmaster, was lost; a valiant and
greatly experienced soldier, and whom Spinola highly
esteemed, both for his deeds and counsel. With the like
progress, and no less loss of blood, did the other nations
advance. So as the enemies at last lost all the fortifications
which they had without their principal line; about
which a great ditch ran, but not so hard to pass as was
the channel which fenced the counterscarp. The easier
doing of it made the Catholics hope better in the effecting
thereof; wherefore, full of fresh courage, they prepared
to continue their labours more heartily than ever,
that they might the sooner end the siege; but the winter
being already come on did much injure their works, and
the sea did then more destroy them by her tempests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The enemy did likewise make very fierce opposition;
they set up batteries within against the batteries without;
mines opposed countermines; they repaired themselves
on all sides, and as fast as one rampire was lost they set
up another. So as the Catholics were to advance by
inchmeal; and yet they did so advance, as by the spring
they were got well forward into the ditch.</p>

<p>“These already progressions of Marquis Spinola,
together with his still daily proceedings, made the United
Provinces shrewdly afraid that they should at last lose
Ostend. It was therefore consulted amongst their chief
commanders how the town might be best preserved:
which might be done by two ways; either by some important
diversion, or by raising the siege by main force.
The second affair brought with it such difficulties, as the
first was embraced. Wherefore they resolved to besiege
Sluce; a town which likewise stood upon the sea, and of
so great consequence, as did rather exceed than come
short of those of Ostend.”</p>

<p>Sluys was accordingly besieged and taken, to the great
satisfaction of the Flemish, that, in three months’ time
and with the loss of so little blood, they had made a
greater acquisition than that of Ostend, which would
cost above three years’ expense of time, and an infinity
of Spanish gold and blood, if it could hold out no longer.
But though Spinola made an unsuccessful attempt to relieve
Sluys, he could not be prevailed on to break up the
siege of Ostend, and his troops were inflamed the more
by a desire of counterbalancing that loss. So that at last,
after much slaughter, they won the ditch and the first
line of fortifications; but meanwhile a new one had been
raised by those within.</p>

<p>“Sluce was just then lost: and it was feared that
Count Maurice would come to the relief of Ostend. The
Catholics being therefore so much the more moved, and
Spinola being again returned, it is not to be expressed
with what fervour they fell to their works on all sides.
The greatest progress was made towards the old town of
Ostend; and because when they should have won that,
they might easily hinder the entrance into the channel, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the mouth whereof succour was brought from the sea;
and for that the new town was much commanded by the
old, therefore Spinola did the more reinforce his batteries,
assaults, mines, and all his other most efficacious works
on that side than on any other; nor was it long ere the
Catholics had almost wholly taken it.</p>

<p>“They likewise advanced after the same manner
against the new fortifications, so as now the besieged had
no where whither to retreat; wherefore, wanting ground
to defend, when they most abounded in all things for defence,
they were at last forced to surrender the town;
which was done about the midst of September, upon all
the most honourable conditions that they could desire.
Count Maurice was often minded to attempt the succour
by main force; but considering that he was to enter into
an enemy’s country, amongst strong and well&ndash;guarded
towns, and that he should meet with men that were very
ready to fight, he thought it not fit, after his prosperous
success at Sluce, to hazard falling into some misfortune, as
upon such an occasion he might peradventure do, and
therefore he forebore to do it. It was a remarkable
thing to see so many soldiers march out of a town; for
there were above four thousand of them, all strong and
healthful, they having enjoyed great plenty of all things
in Ostend, by reason of their continual succours. So as
besides great store of artillery, there was found in the
town such abundance of victuals, ammunition, and of
whatsoever else may be imagined for the defence of a
royal town, as the like was never known to be in any
other place.</p>

<p>“Thus ended the siege of Ostend; very memorable,
doubtless, in itself, but much more in consideration of the
so great expense of monies and time which the winning
and losing of it cost. The siege continued above three
years; in which time the constant opinion was, that there
died, what by the sword, what by sickness, above a hundred
thousand men between the one and the other side;
whereby it may be conceived what proportionable monies
and other things were therein spent. The town being
yielded up, the Archduke and Infanta had the curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to go see it, and went from Gaunt thither, where they
found nothing but a misshapen chaos of earth, which
hardly retained any show of the first Ostend. Ditches
filled up; curtains beaten down; bulwarks torn in pieces;
half&ndash;moons, flanks, and redoubts so confused one with
another, as one could not be distinguished from another;
nor could it be known on which side the oppugnation, or
on which side the defence was; yet they would know
all, and receive the whole relation from Spinola’s own
mouth. He represented at full the last posture of the
siege: he showed the Spaniards’ quarters, and that of
the Italians, as also those of each other nation. He related
how stoutly they contended who should outvie one
another in painstaking; on which part the greatest resistance
was made within: where the dispute was most
difficult without; where they wanted ground to retreat
unto; where the enemy used their utmost power; and
where at last the town was surrendered. The Archduke
saw the great platform, the great dyke, and whatsoever
else of curious might be suggested by the unusual
face of that siege; but not without the Infanta’s great
compassion, and even almost tears, by looking upon the
horror of those parts where the sword, fire, sea, and earth
may be said to have conspired together in making so long
and so miserable a destruction of Christians. They both
of them did very much commend Spinola, and did also
thank the rest of the commanders who had deserved well
in that enterprise. Nor did they less gratulate the inferior
officers and soldiers, who had exposed themselves
most to those dangers.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Remarkable in modern history is the siege and storm of
Magdeburg in the thirty years’ war by the Imperial troops,
commanded by Tilly, when that general blighted the
laurels acquired in thirty&ndash;six successful battles, and fixed
an indelible stain upon his reputation. Even poetical
justice might be satisfied by the events of his after&ndash;life,
which, from a series of victories became one of reverses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
produced in part, at least, by his own act, if it be true
that the excesses perpetrated on this occasion produced
a lasting bad effect on the discipline of his army. But,
on the plains of Leipzic, in the person of Gustavus
Adolphus, he met at length with his superior in the art
of war.</p>

<p>“I must now arm my breast with sternness, my heart
with impenetrability, while I relate the events which
broke in foaming billows over this wretched city,—events,
for their magnitude, extraordinary: for their mournfulness,
but too calamitous; for their importance, rarely
known in former ages; and for their rarity, easily unheard
of. So may this mind be able to recite the reverses,
the tragic incidents which in this our age, by inevitable
destiny, have oppressed Magdeburg, a city of
the empire, powerful and strong as ancient,—this pen
endure through the description of such horrid destruction.
But whence to commence the tempests of so pitiable an
event? whence seek those dreadful varieties of punishment,
for the relation of which all Germany is scarce
sufficient? I am far from thinking that with this pen I
can do justice to so mournful, so extraordinary a calamity.
For he who would worthily express a catastrophe, which
will amaze furthest posterity, must needs be qualified by
an iron memory, a strong and unconquered style, since
it is his duty to find words answerable to actions.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The modest doubts expressed in the above rather
pompous passage have not restrained the historian, from
whom we quote, from proving, in a long and tedious
narrative, that he justly estimated the relative extent of
his subject and his powers. We purpose to take warning
by his example, and act upon the diffidence which
he expresses. The reader is as capable of imagining,
as the author, unless an eye&ndash;witness, of describing, the
behaviour of soldiers flushed with rage and blood let
loose upon an unarmed population: and either is likely
to produce but a confused picture, made up chiefly by
ringing the changes upon what the author of ‘Old Mortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>’
calls “the four pleas of the crown.” Instead,
therefore, of multiplying anecdotes of brutality and suffering,
we shall only give the narratives of two eyewitnesses,
the simplicity of which is a guarantee for
their truth. The first is written by the minister of a
church in Magdeburg. It is necessary to premise that
the assault was made at daybreak, as the hour when the
garrison were most likely to be off their guard, and at a
time when a general belief was entertained that Tilly was
about to break up the siege. It was therefore entirely
unexpected.</p>

<p>“Going out of church immediately after sermon, some
people of St. James’s parish passed by, and told me the
enemy had entered the town. With difficulty could I
persuade myself that this was anything more than a false
alarm; but the news unfortunately proved too true. I
then lost my presence of mind, and as my wife and
maid&ndash;servant were with me, we ran directly to my colleague,
M. Malsio’s house, and left our own house open.
At M. Malsio’s we found many people, who had fled to
him in great perplexity. We comforted and exhorted
each other, as far as the terror of our minds would give
us leave. I was summoned thence to discharge the last
duties to a colonel, who lay dangerously wounded. I
resolved to go, and sent my maid to fetch my gown: but
before my departure from my wife and neighbours, I
told them that the affair appeared to me to be concluded,
and that we should meet no more in this world. My
wife reproached me in a flood of tears, crying, ‘Can
you prevail on yourself to leave me to perish all alone?
You must answer for it before God!’ I represented to
her the obligations of my function, and the importance
of the moments I was called upon to give my assistance
in.</p>

<p>“As I crossed the great street a multitude of matrons
and young women flocked about me, and besought me,
in all the agonies of distress, to advise them what to do.
I told them, my best advice was to recommend themselves
to God’s protecting grace, and prepare for death.
At length I entered the colonel’s lodging, and found him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
stretched on the floor, and very weak. I gave him such
consolation as the disorder of my mind would permit me:
he heard me with great attention, and ordered a small
present of gold to be given me, which I left on the
table. In this interval, the enemy poured in by crowds
at the Hamburg gate, and fired on the multitude as upon
beasts of prey. Suddenly my wife and maid&ndash;servant
entered the room, and persuaded me to remove immediately,
alleging we should meet with no quarter, if the
enemy found us in an apartment filled with arms. We
ran down into the court&ndash;yard of the house, and placed
ourselves in the gateway. Our enemies soon burst the
gate open, with an eagerness that cannot be described.
The first address they made to me was, ‘Priest, deliver
thy money.’ I gave them about four and twenty shillings
in a little box, which they accepted with good will:
but when they opened the box, and found only silver,
they raised their tone, and demanded gold. I represented
to them that I was at some distance from my house,
and could not at present possibly give them more. They
were reasonable enough to be contented with my answer,
and left us, after having plundered the house, without
offering us any insult. There was a well&ndash;looking youth
among the crowd, to whom my wife addressed herself,
and besought him in God’s name to protect us: ‘My
dear child,’ said he, ‘it is a thing impossible; we must
pursue our enemies;’ and so they retired.</p>

<p>“In that moment another party of soldiers rushed in,
who demanded also our money. We contented them
with seven shillings and a couple of silver spoons, which
the maid fortunately had concealed in her pocket. They
were scarce gone before a soldier entered alone with the
most furious countenance I ever saw; each cheek was
puffed out with a musket&ndash;ball, and he carried two muskets
on his shoulder. The moment he perceived me, he
cried with a voice of thunder, ‘Priest, give me thy
money, or thou art dead.’ As I had nothing to give
him, I made my apology in the most affecting manner:
he levelled a piece to shoot me, but my wife luckily
turned it with her hand, and the ball passed over my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
head. At length, finding we had no money, he asked
for plate: my wife gave him some silver trinkets, and he
went his way.</p>

<p>“A little after came four or five soldiers, who only
said, ‘Wicked priest, what doest thou here?’ Having
said thus much, they departed.</p>

<p>“We were now inclined to shelter ourselves in the
uppermost lodgings of the house, hoping there to be less
exposed and better concealed. We entered a chamber
that had several beds in it, and passed some time there
in the most insupportable agonies. Nothing was heard
in the streets but the cries of the expiring people; nor
were the houses much more quiet; every thing was burst
open or cut to pieces. We were soon discovered in our
retirement: a number of soldiers poured in, and one who
carried a hatchet made an attempt to cleave my skull,
but a companion hindered him and said, ‘Comrade,
what are you doing? Don’t you perceive that he is a
clergyman?’</p>

<p>“When these were gone a single soldier came in, to
whom my wife gave a crape handkerchief off her neck;
upon which he retired without offering us any injury.
His successor was not so reasonable: for entering the
chamber with his sword drawn, he immediately discharged
a blow upon my head, saying, ‘Priest, give me
thy money.’ The stroke stunned me; the blood gushed
out in abundance, and frightened my wife and servant to
that degree that they both continued motionless. The
barbarian turned round to my wife, aimed a blow at her,
but it glanced fortunately on her gown, which happened
to be lined with furs, and wounded her not. Amazed
to see us so submissive and patient, he looked at us
fixedly for some moments. I laid hold of this interval
to represent to him that I was not in my own house,
being come to the place where I was to discharge my
duty to a dying person, but if he would grant us quarter,
and protect us to our home, I would then bestow upon
him all I had. ‘Agreed, priest,’ said he, ‘give me thy
wealth, and I will give thee the watchword: it is Jesu
Maria; pronounce that, and no one will hurt thee.’ We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
went down stairs directly, highly contented to have
found such a protector. The street was covered with
the dead and dying; their cries were enough to have
pierced the hearts of the greatest barbarians. We
walked over the bodies, and when we arrived at the
church of St. Catherine, met an officer of distinction on
horseback. This generous person soon discovered us,
and seeing me covered with blood, said to the person
who conducted us, ‘Fellow&ndash;soldier, fellow&ndash;soldier, take
care what you do to these persons.’ At the same time
he said to my wife, ‘Madam, is yonder house yours?’
My wife having answered that it was, ‘Well,’ added he,
‘take hold of my stirrup, conduct me thither, and you
shall have quarter.’ Then turning to me, and making a
sign to the soldiers with his hand, he said to me, ‘Gentlemen
of Magdeburg, you yourselves are the occasion of
this destruction: you might have acted otherwise.’ The
soldier who had used me ill, took this opportunity to
steal away. Upon entering my house, we found it filled
with a multitude of plunderers, whom the officer, who
was a colonel, ordered away. He then said he would
take up his lodging with us, and having posted two soldiers
for a guard to us, left us with a promise to return
forthwith. We gave, with great cheerfulness, a good
breakfast to our sentinels, who complimented us on the
lucky fortune of falling into their colonel’s hands; at the
same time representing to us that their fellow&ndash;soldiers
made a considerable booty while they continued inactive
merely as a safe&ndash;guard to us, and, therefore beseeching us
to render them an equivalent to a certain degree. Upon
this I gave them four rose&ndash;nobles, with which they were
well contented, and showed so much humanity as to
make us an offer to go and search for any acquaintance
whom we desired to place in safety with us. I told
them I had one particular friend who had escaped to the
cathedral, as I conjectured, and promised them a good
gratuity on his part if they saved his life. One of them
accompanied by my maid&ndash;servant went to the church,
and called my friend often by name; but it was all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
vain, no one answered, and we never heard mention of
him from that period.</p>

<p>“Some moments after our colonel returned, and asked
if any person had offered us the least incivility. After
we had disculpated the soldiers in this respect, he hastened
abroad to see if there was any possibility to extinguish
the fire, which had already seized great part of the
city: he had hardly got into the street, when he returned,
with uncommon hastiness, and said, ‘Show me
the way out of the town, for I see plainly we shall perish
in the flames if we stay here a few minutes longer.’
Upon this we threw the best of our goods and moveables
into a vaulted cellar, covered the trap&ndash;door with
earth, and made our escape. My wife took nothing
with her but my robe; my maid seized a neighbour’s
infant child by the hand, whom we found crying at his
father’s door, and led him away. We found it impossible
to pass through the gates of the town, which were
all in a flame, and the streets burnt with great fury on
either side: in a word, the heat was so intense that it
was with difficulty we were able to breathe. Having
made several unsuccessful attempts, we determined at
last to make our escape on the side of the town next the
Elbe. The streets were clogged with dead bodies, and
the groans of the dying were insupportable. The Walloons
and Croatians attacked us every moment, but our
generous colonel protected us from their fury. When
we gained the bastion, which stands on the bank of the
Elbe, we descended it by the scaling&ndash;ladders which the
Imperialists had made use of in the assault, and arrived
at length in the enemy’s camp near Rottensee, thoroughly
fatigued and extremely alarmed.</p>

<p>“The colonel made us enter his tent, and presented
us some refreshments. That ceremony being over,
‘Well,’ said he, ‘having saved your lives, what return
do you make me?’ We told him that for the present
we had nothing to bestow, but that we would transfer to
him all the money and plate that we had buried in the
cellar, which was the whole of our worldly possessions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
At this instant many Imperial officers came in, and one
chanced to say to me, ‘Ego tibi condoleo, ego sum addictus
Fidei Augustanæ.’ The distressed state I found
myself in made me unable to give a proper reply to the
condolences of a man who carried arms against those
whose religion he professed, and whose hard fortune he
pretended to deplore.</p>

<p>“Next day the colonel sent one of his domestics with
my maid&ndash;servant to search for the treasure we had buried
in the cellar, but they returned without success, because
as the fire still continued they could not approach the
trap&ndash;door. In the mean while the colonel made us his
guests at his own table, and during our whole stay
treated us not as prisoners, but as intimate friends.</p>

<p>“One day at dinner an officer of the company happened
to say, that our sins were the cause of all the evil
we suffered, and that God had made use of the Catholic
army to chastise us; to whom my wife replied, that the
observation perhaps was but too true; however, take
care, continued she, lest God in the end should throw
that very scourge into the flames. This sort of prophecy
was fulfilled soon afterwards on the self&ndash;same Imperial
army, which was almost totally destroyed at the battle
of Leipzic.</p>

<p>“At length I ventured one day to ask our colonel to
give us leave to depart: he complied immediately, on
condition that we paid our ransom. Next morning I
sent my maid into the town to try if there was any possibility
of penetrating into the cellar: she was more fortunate
that day, and returned with all our wealth.
Having returned our thanks to our deliverer, he immediately
ordered a passport to be prepared for us, with
permission to retire to whatever place we should think
proper, and made us a present of a crown to defray the
expense of our journey. This brave Spaniard was colonel
of the regiment of Savelli, and named Don Joseph
de Ainsa.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The sack of Magdeburg was an event of uncommon
atrocity, and abhorred as such even in that age. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
from the sort of clemency experienced by this clergyman,
who was plundered of his goods after having nearly lost
his life, and yet seems to feel much gratitude to his protector,
we may imagine the treatment which the peasantry
and citizens received from the rude soldiery of that time.
These men, both officers and soldiers, were in a great
degree mercenaries, who resorted to the wars expressly
to mend their fortunes, and were not likely to exercise
the presumed rights of the victor with much moderation.
Few of their generals had much sympathy with the
sufferings of non&ndash;combatants, of peaceable countrymen,
and wealthy burghers; and those who might have been
inclined to enforce discipline and soften the evils of war,
were shackled by the deficiency of financial resources,
and the consequent irregularity in issuing pay and other
requisites to their armies. “There are things, my lord,
in the service of that great prince (Gustavus Adolphus)
that cannot but go against the stomach of any cavalier of
honour. In especial, albeit the pay be none of the most
superabundant, being only about sixty rix&ndash;dollars a month
to a captain; yet the invincible Gustavus never paid
above one&ndash;third of that sum, which was distributed
monthly by way of loan, although when justly considered
it was in fact a borrowing by that great monarch
of the additional two&ndash;thirds, which were due to the
soldier.”</p>

<p>“But were not these arrears,” said Lord Monteith,
“paid to the soldiery at some stated period?” “My
lord,” said Dalgetty, “I take it upon my conscience
that at no period, and by no possible process, could one
creutzer of them ever be recovered. I myself never saw
twenty dollars of my own all the time I served the invincible
Gustavus, unless it was from the chance of a
storm or victory, or the fetching in of some town or
doorp, when a cavalier of fortune who knows the usage
of wars, seldom faileth to make some small profit.”</p>

<p>“I begin rather to wonder, sir,” said Lord Monteith,
“that you should have continued so long in the Swedish
service, than that you should have ultimately withdrawn
from it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Neither should I,” answered the captain, “but that
great leader, captain and king, the Lion of the North,
and bulwark of the Protestant faith, had a way of
winning battles, taking towns, over&ndash;running countries,
and levying contributions, whilk made his service irresistibly
delectable to all true&ndash;bred cavaliers who follow the
noble profession of arms. Simple as I ride here, my
lord, I have myself commanded the whole stift of Dunklespiel
on the Lower Rhine, occupying the Palsgrave’s
palace, consuming his choice wines with my comrades,
calling in contributions, requisitions, and caduacs, and
failing not to lick my fingers as became a good cook.
But truly all this glory hastened to decay after our great
master had been shot with three bullets, upon the field
of Lutzen; wherefore, finding that fortune had changed
sides, that the borrowings and lendings went on as before
out of our pay, while the caduacs and casualties were
all cut off, I e’en gave up my commission, and took
service with Wallenstein in Walter Butler’s Irish regiment.”</p>

<p>“And may I beg to know of you,” said Lord Monteith,
“how you liked this change of masters?”</p>

<p>“Indifferent well,” said the captain, “very indifferent
well. I cannot say that the Emperor paid much better
than the great Gustavus. For hard knocks, we had
plenty of them. * * * Howbeit, in despite of heavy
blows and light pay, a cavalier of fortune may thrive indifferently
well in the Imperial service, in respect his
private casualties are nothing so closely looked to as by
the Swede; and so that an officer did his duty on the
field, neither Wallenstein nor Pappenheim, nor old Tilly
before them, would likely listen to the objurgations of
boors or burghers against any commander or soldado by
whom they chanced to be somewhat closely shorn. So
that an experienced cavalier, ‘knowing how to lay,’ as
our Scottish phrase runs, ‘the head of the sow to
the tail of the grice,’ might get out of the country
the pay which he could not obtain from the Emperor.”</p>

<p>“With a full hand, sir, doubtless, and with interest,”
said Lord Monteith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indubitably, my lord,” answered Dalgetty, composedly;
“for it would be doubly disgraceful for any soldado
of rank to have his name called in question for any
petty delinquency.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>We do not quote the great romancer as historical authority;
but there is no doubt but that Captain Dalgetty,
though perhaps highly coloured, is no unfaithful likeness
of those needy and profligate adventurers who bartered
blood for gold, and formed a large portion of the armies
of the age, indifferent on which side they fought, and
constant only while pay, plunder, or promotion were at
hand to reward their services.</p>

<p>The other narrative is that of a fisherman, a child at
the time of this event, who is said to have survived it
nearly ninety years.</p>

<p>“The 10th of May, early in the morning, at the time
the master of our school was reading prayers, a report
flew through the streets that the town was taken, which
was confirmed by the ringing of the alarm bells. Our
master dismissed us all in a moment, saying, ‘My dear
children, hasten to your homes, and recommend yourselves
to the protection of God; for it is highly probable
we shall meet no more except in heaven.’ In an instant
we all disappeared, some one way, and some another.
For my own part, I took my course with speed along
the high street; and found where the public steelyards
are (and where the grand guard of the city was kept), a
considerable body of troops with their swords drawn;
and saw near them, and at a distance round them, a great
number of soldiers stretched dead upon the pavement.
Terrified with so melancholy a sight, I shaped my
course down the street called Pelican, with a view to
conceal myself in my father’s house; but had hardly
advanced a few steps, before I fell in with a band of
soldiers who had that moment murdered a man whom I
saw weltering in his blood. This sight shocked me to
such a degree, that I had not power to move forwards;
but sheltering myself in a house opposite to the Pelican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
inn, found a kind&ndash;speaking middle&ndash;aged man, who said to
me, ‘Child, why comest thou hither? save thyself before
the soldiers seize thee.’ I was strongly tempted to put
his advice in practice; but in that moment a party of
Croatians rushed in, and holding a sabre to his throat,
demanded his wealth. The old man immediately opened
a coffer to them, full of gold and silver, and precious
stones. They crammed their pockets with his riches;
yet as the coffer was not emptied, they filled a small
basket with the part that remained, and then shot the
poor old man through the head. I stole away behind
them, and found a place of safety among some empty
casks, and there found a young lady, perfectly handsome,
who conjured me to remove and make no mention of her.
Anxiously reflecting where to dispose of myself, the
same Croatians surprised me again, and one of them said,
‘Bastardly dog, carry this basket for us.’ I took it up
immediately, and followed them wherever they went.
They entered several cellars, and rifled women, maidens,
and all persons that fell into their hands, without remorse.
As we ascended from one of these cellars, we
saw with astonishment that the flames had seized upon
the whole fore part of the house. We rushed through
the fire, and saved ourselves. In all probability, every
soul was destroyed that remained within doors. As for
my father, mother, and relations, I never heard a syllable
concerning them from that time to the present.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This last sentence expresses briefly and emphatically
the fate of the population. The whole town was burnt,
except the cathedral, the convent of Notre Dame, with
a few houses about it, and about a hundred and thirty
fishermen’s cottages on the banks of the Elbe. The
number of the slain cannot be distinctly ascertained, for
we have no certain knowledge of the population of the
city; but the slaughter seems to have been almost universal.
It is said, however, that according to the computation
of those who were appointed to clear the
streets, 6440 bodies were thrown into the Elbe; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
this does not include those, probably much the greater
number, who were massacred in their houses, and buried
under the ruins, or consumed in the general conflagration.
One author says that 30,000 persons perished; Harte,
that of 40,000 inhabitants, scarce 800 it was thought
escaped: but contemporary authors vary in their numbers,
which indeed in these cases can hardly ever be
ascertained with certainty. The only lives expressly
said to have been preserved, are those of 400 persons
who took refuge in the cathedral; and in the Florus
Germanicus, published only ten years later (a book
written in the Imperial interest), it is asserted that none
other were spared, and these only from respect to the
sanctity of the place. The author, however, reduces
their number to a hundred. Others must have been
saved, like those whose narratives are given above, by
chance, or individual compassion; but it is plain that indiscriminate
destruction was the order of the day. This
massacre will be an everlasting blot upon Tilly’s reputation.
He remained without the town; and when solicited
by those who had witnessed the horrors acted
within, to stop the indiscriminate slaughter, he replied,
“The town must bleed; it has not yet made sufficient
expiation. Let the soldiers persist another hour, and
then we will reconsider the matter.” According to
another story, he said that the soldiers must have some
recompense for so much time and trouble. Yet, say the
historians of his own party, when on the third day he
rode over the crackling ashes, and through piles of corpses,
he wept as he quoted some lines of Virgil, relative to the
destruction of Troy.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>There was no want of prodigies to foretell the fate of
Magdeburg, by monstrous births, the fall of towers, and
other circumstances of equal moment; several of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the curious reader will find mentioned by Harte, and
many more minutely described by Lotichius, as above
quoted. Such follies must have been deeply implanted
in men’s minds when a Christian writer, in the seventeenth
century, has thought it worthwhile to corroborate
one of these omens by quoting a similar one from
Valerius Maximus.</p>

<p>The engineer’s art has materially diminished the interest
of modern sieges, by reducing them, independent
of external relief, almost to certainty, and substituting
the combinations of science for the personal exertions of
the soldier. The warfare of trenches and batteries, by
which outwork after outwork is rendered untenable,
often without a bayonet being crossed in their defence,
fails to rivet the attention, and indeed is scarce intelligible
without some share of professional knowledge. It
is not until the cannon have done their work, and
opened a way to individual strength and courage, not
until the assaulting columns are ready to ascend the
breach, that the deep interest is roused which even
against our better judgment attends on military daring.
Still, after giving so many various specimens of this
branch of warfare, it may naturally be supposed that we
shall not pass in silence over all the brilliant actions of
our own time: and the attention is at once directed to
the Peninsular war, not only as the field in which the
military energy of our empire was most successfully developed,
but because it produced a great number of
sieges of remarkable interest; while not one such occurs
in the campaigns which Napoleon conducted in person.
A volume of sieges might be compiled from this war,
illustrative both of military resolution and of popular
energy and desperation: no wonder then if we have
hesitated between the contending claims of Zaragoza
and Gerona. The latter city is the favourite of Colonel
Napier, who cites its resistance to prove how far the
regulated warfare of a disciplined force is superior to the
enthusiasm of a population untrained to arms. The
grounds of his preference are briefly these. Zaragoza
was manned by above 30,000 soldiers and 25,000 armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a><br /><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
citizens and peasants; but she wanted heavy artillery,
regular fortifications, and a controlling spirit: for both
the reputation and authority of Palafox appear to have
been nominal, and it is to the influence of plebeian
leaders that the ferocious energy of the defence is to be
ascribed. Gerona contained about 3000 regular troops,
and less than 6000 armed citizens; but she was well
fortified, and commanded by an experienced and resolute
officer. With this inferior force she held out twice as
long as Zaragoza against a superior attacking army, conducted
the defence in regular military order, and kept
the enemy without her defences, instead of admitting
him to wage a desperate struggle on her hearthstones
and in her churches. On these grounds the defenders
of Gerona may merit the preference assigned to them by
Colonel Napier for having displayed equal bravery and
devotion, with better fortune or greater skill. Still the
irregular and desperate struggle in the streets of Zaragoza,
where every house was a fortress, the end of every
street a battery, where miner counterplotted miner, and
every foot of ground was purchased by blood and ruin,
will win the attention of more readers than would the
systematic warfare carried on under the walls of Gerona.</p>

<p>Zaragoza is situated on the right bank of the Ebro.
Before its first siege, in 1808, it contained 50,000 inhabitants.
It possessed no regular defences, and few
guns fit for service, but was surrounded by a low brick
wall. These deficiencies were in some degree remedied
by the nature of its buildings, which were well calculated
for the internal warfare subsequently carried on:
the houses being mostly built of brick and stone, and
vaulted, so as to be almost incombustible. The city was
also full of churches and convents, strongly built, and
surrounded by high thick walls. A broad street, called
the Cosso, bent almost into a semicircle, concentric with
the wall, and terminated at each end by the Ebro,
divided the city into an outer and an inner part. It
occupied the ground on which the Moorish walls had
formerly stood, before the city attained its present size.
This street was the scene of that heroic resistance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
1808, which kept the French at bay after the walls and
one&ndash;half of the place had fallen into their hands. On
the 3rd of August, rather more than a month after the
commencement of the siege, the convent of St. Engracia,
which formed part of the wall, was breached; and on
the 4th it was stormed, and the victorious troops carried
all before them as far as the Cosso, and before night
were in possession of one&ndash;half of the city. The French
general now considered the city as his own, and summoned
it to surrender in a note containing only these
words: “Head&ndash;quarters, St. Engracia: Capitulation.”
The emphatic reply is well&ndash;known, and will become
proverbial: “Head&ndash;quarters, Zaragoza: War to the
knife.”</p>

<p>“The contest which was now carried on is unexampled
in history. One side of the Cosso, a street about as
wide as Pall&ndash;Mall, was possessed by the French, and in
the centre of it their general, Verdier, gave his orders
from the Franciscan convent. The opposite side was
maintained by the Arragonese, who threw up batteries
at the openings of the cross&ndash;streets, within a few paces
of those which the French erected against them. The
intervening space was presently heaped with dead,
either slain upon the spot, or thrown out from the windows.
Next day, the ammunition of the citizens began
to fail: the French were expected every moment to
renew their efforts for completing the conquest, and even
this circumstance occasioned no dismay, nor did any one
think of capitulation. One cry was heard from the
people, whenever Palafox rode amongst them, that if
powder failed, they were ready to attack the enemy
with their knives—formidable weapons in the hands of
desperate men. Just before the day closed, Don Francisco
Palafox, the general’s brother, entered the city
with a convoy of arms and ammunition, and a reinforcement
of 3000 men, composed of Spanish guards, Swiss,
and volunteers of Arragon: a succour as little expected
by the Zaragozans, as it had been provided against by
the enemy.</p>

<p>“The war was now continued from street to street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
from house to house, and from room to room; pride and
indignation having wrought up the French to a pitch of
obstinate fury, little inferior to the devoted courage of
the patriots. During the whole siege no man distinguished
himself more remarkably than the curate of
one of the parishes within the walls, by name P. Santiago
Suss. He was always to be seen in the streets,
sometimes fighting with the most determined bravery,
at other times administering the sacrament to the dying,
and confirming with the authority of faith that hope,
which gives to death, under such circumstances, the joy,
the exaltation, the triumph, and the spirit of martyrdom.
Palafox reposed the utmost confidence in the brave
priest, and selected him when anything peculiarly
difficult or hazardous was to be done. At the head of
forty chosen men he succeeded in introducing into the
town a supply of powder so essentially necessary for its
defence.</p>

<p>“This most obstinate and murderous conflict was
continued for eleven successive days and nights, more
indeed by night than by day; for it was almost certain
death to appear by daylight within reach of those
houses which were occupied by the other party. But
under cover of the darkness, the combatants frequently
dashed across the street to attack each other’s batteries;
and the battles which began there were often carried
on into the houses beyond, where they fought from room
to room, and from floor to floor. The hostile batteries
were so near each other, that a Spaniard in one place
made way under cover of the dead bodies which completely
filled the space between them, and fastened a
rope to one of the French cannons; in the struggle
which ensued the rope broke, and the Zaragozans lost
their prize at the very moment when they thought themselves
sure of it.</p>

<p>“A new horror was added to the dreadful circumstances
of war in this ever memorable siege. In general
engagements the dead are left upon the field of battle,
and the survivors removed to clear ground and an untainted
atmosphere; but here, in Spain, and in the month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of August, there where the dead lay the struggle was
still carried on, and pestilence was dreaded from the
enormous accumulation of putrefying bodies. Nothing
in the whole course of the siege so much embarrassed
Palafox as this evil. The only remedy was to tie ropes
to the French prisoners, and push them forward amid the
dead and dying, to remove the bodies and bring them away
for interment. Even for this necessary office there was no
truce, and it would have been certain death to the Arragonese
who should have attempted to perform it: but
the prisoners were in general secured by the pity of
their own soldiers, and in this manner the evil was in
some degree diminished.</p>

<p>“A council of war was held by the Spaniards on the
8th, not for the purpose which is too usual in such
councils, but that their heroic resolution might be communicated
to the people. It was, that in those quarters
of the city where the Arragonese still maintained their
ground, they should continue to defend themselves
with the same firmness: should the enemy at last prevail,
they were then to retire over the Ebro into the
suburbs, break down the bridge, and defend the suburbs
till they perished. When this resolution was made
public, it was received with the loudest acclamations.
But in every conflict the citizens now gained ground
upon the soldiers, winning it inch by inch, till the space
occupied by the enemy, which on the day of their entrance
was nearly half the city, was reduced gradually
to about an eighth part. Meantime intelligence of the
events in other parts of Spain was received by the
French, all tending to dishearten them. During the
night of the 13th, their fire was particularly fierce and
destructive: in the morning, the French columns, to the
great surprise of the Spaniards, were seen at a distance
retreating over the plain, on the road to Pampeluna.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Zaragoza, however, was a place of too much importance
long to enjoy in quiet her hard&ndash;earned laurels. In
the course of the autumn, the French recovered their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
superiority in Arragon, and had no sooner done so, than
they bent their strength to repair the disgrace which
their arms had sustained, and overthrow the firmest bulwark
of independence in the western provinces of Spain.
The inhabitants, aware that their heroic resistance had
purchased only a temporary deliverance, employed the
intervening time in repairing and improving their external
defences, and still more so in preparing to renew
to greater advantage that internal conflict, in which experience
had shown their real strength to exist.</p>

<p>“It has already been observed, that the houses of
Zaragoza were fire&ndash;proof, and generally of only two
stories, and that in all the quarters of the city the
numerous and massive convents and churches rose like
castles above the low buildings, and that the greater
streets running into the broadway, called the Cosso,
divided the town into a variety of districts, unequal in
size, but each containing one or more large structures.
Now the citizens, sacrificing all personal convenience,
and resigning all idea of private property, gave up their
goods, their bodies, and their houses to the war; and
being promiscuously mingled with the peasantry and the
regular soldiers, the whole formed one mighty garrison,
well suited to the vast fortress into which Zaragoza was
transformed: for the doors and windows of the houses
were built up, and their fronts loop&ndash;holed; internal communications
were broken through the party&ndash;walls, and
the streets were trenched and crossed by earthen ramparts
mounted with cannon, and every strong building
was turned into a separate fortification. There was no
weak point, because there could be none in a town which
was all fortress, and where the space covered by the city
was the measurement for the thickness of the ramparts;
nor in this emergency were the leaders unmindful of
moral force.</p>

<p>“The people were cheered by a constant reference to
their former successful resistance; their confidence was
raised by the contemplation of the vast works that had
been executed; and it was recalled to their recollection
that the wet, usual at that season of the year, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
spread disease among the enemy’s ranks, and impair, if
not entirely frustrate, his efforts. Neither was the aid
of superstition neglected: processions imposed upon the
sight, false miracles bewildered the imagination, and
terrible denunciations of divine wrath shook the minds
of men whose former habits and present situation rendered
them peculiarly susceptible of such impressions.
Finally, the leaders were themselves so prompt and
terrible in their punishments, that the greatest cowards
were likely to show the boldest bearing, in their wish to
escape suspicion.</p>

<p>“To avoid the danger of any great explosion, the
powder was made as occasion required; and this was the
more easily effected, because Zaragoza contained a royal
depôt and refinery for saltpetre, and there were powder&ndash;mills
in the neighbourhood, which furnished workmen
familiar with the process of manufacturing that article.
The houses and trees beyond the walls were all demolished
and cut down, and the materials carried into
the town. The public magazines contained six months’
provisions; the convents were well stocked; and the inhabitants
had likewise laid up their own stores for several
months. General Doyle had also sent a convoy into the
town from the side of Catalonia, and there was abundance
of money, because, in addition to the resources of
the town, the military chest of Castaños’s army, which
had been supplied only the night before the battle of
Tudela, had been in the flight carried into the town.</p>

<p>“Companies of women, enrolled to attend the hospitals,
and to carry provisions and ammunition to the
combatants, were commanded by the Countess Burita, a
lady of an heroic disposition, who is said to have displayed
the greatest intelligence and the noblest character
during both sieges. There were thirteen engineer
officers, and 800 sappers and miners, composed of excavators,
formerly employed on the canal, and there were
from 1500 to 2000 cannoneers.</p>

<p>“The regular troops that fled from Tudela being
joined by two small divisions which retreated at the
same time from Sanguessa and Caparosa, formed a garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of 30,000 men, and together with the inhabitants
and peasantry presented a mass of 50,000 combatants,
who with passions excited almost to frenzy awaited an
assault amidst those mighty entrenchments, where each
man’s home was a fortress and his family a garrison. To
besiege with only 35,000 men a city so prepared was
truly a gigantic undertaking.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>It was on December 20, 1808, that Marshals Moncey
and Mortier appeared in front of the town. We pass
over the early part of the siege, which contains nothing
to distinguish it from a multitude of others. The
French, supported by a powerful battering and mortar
train, advanced their trenches slowly towards the town
until January 22, when Marshal Lasnes arrived to
assume the command. On the 29th four breaches were
declared practicable. That night four columns rushed
to the assault; one was repulsed, the other three
established themselves, and the ramparts of the city
became the front line of the French trenches.</p>

<p>“The walls of Zaragoza thus went to the ground, but
Zaragoza herself remained erect; and as the broken
girdle fell from the heroic city, the besiegers started at
the view of her naked strength. The regular defences
had indeed crumbled before the skill of the assailants,
but the popular resistance was immediately called with
its terrors into action. * * * The war being now carried
into the streets of Zaragoza, the sound of the alarm&ndash;bell
was heard over all the quarters of the city, and the
people assembling in crowds, filled the houses nearest to
the lodgments made by the French. Additional traverses
and barricadoes were constructed across the principal
streets; mines were prepared in the more open
spaces; and the communications from house to house
were multiplied, until they formed a vast labyrinth of
which the intricate windings were only to be traced by
the weapons and the dead bodies of the defenders. The
members of the junta, become more powerful from the
cessation of regular warfare, with redoubled activity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
energy urged the defence, but increased the horrors of
the siege by a ferocity pushed to the very verge of
frenzy. Every person, without regard to rank or age,
who excited the suspicion of these furious men, or those
immediately about them, was instantly put to death;
and amid the noble bulwarks of war a horrid array of
gibbets was to be seen, on which crowds of wretches
were suspended each night, because their courage had
sunk beneath the accumulating dangers of their situation,
or because some doubtful expression or gesture of
distress had been misconstrued by their barbarous chiefs.</p>

<p>“From the heights of the walls which he had conquered,
Marshal Lasnes contemplated this terrific scene;
and judging that men so passionate and so prepared
could not be prudently encountered in open battle, he
resolved to proceed by the slow but certain progress of
the mattock and the mine; and this was also in unison
with the Emperor’s instructions. Hence from the 29th
of January to the 2d February, the efforts of the French
were directed to the enlargement of their lodgment on
the walls; and they succeeded after much severe fighting
and several explosions in working forward through
the nearest houses, but at the same time they had to sustain
many counter&ndash;assaults from the Spaniards.</p>

<p>“It has been already observed that the crossing of the
large streets divided the town into certain small districts
or islands of houses. To gain possession of these, it
was necessary not only to mine but to fight for each
house. To cross the large intersecting streets it was indispensable
to construct traverses above or to work by
underground galleries, because a battery raked each
street, and each house was defended by a garrison that,
generally speaking, had only the option of repelling the
enemy in front, or dying on the gibbet erected behind.
But as long as the convents and churches remained in
possession of the Spaniards, the progress of the French
among the islands of small houses was of little advantage
to them, because the large garrisons in the greater buildings
enabled the defenders not only to make continual
and successful sallies, but also to countermine their enemies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
whose superior skill in that kind of warfare was
often frustrated by the numbers and persevering energy
of the besieged. * * *</p>

<p>“The experience of these attacks<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> induced a change
in the mode of fighting on both sides. Hitherto the
play of the French mines had reduced the houses to
ruins, and thus the soldiers were exposed completely to
the fire from the next Spanish posts. The engineers
therefore diminished the quantity of powder, that the interior
only might fall, and the outward walls stand, and
this method was found successful. Hereupon the
Spaniards, with ready ingenuity, saturated the timbers
and planks of the houses with rosin and pitch, and
setting fire to those which could no longer be maintained,
interposed a burning barrier which often delayed
the assailants for two days, and always prevented
them from pushing their successes during the confusion
that necessarily followed the bursting of the mines.
The fighting was however incessant, a constant bombardment,
the explosion of mines, the crash of falling
buildings, clamorous shouts, and the continued echo of
musketry deafened the ear, while volumes of smoke and
dust clouded the atmosphere, and lowered continually
over the heads of the combatants, as hour by hour the
French with a terrible perseverance pushed forwards
their approaches to the heart of the miserable but
glorious city.</p>

<p>“Their efforts were chiefly directed against two
points, namely, that of San Engracia, which may be denominated
the left attack, and that of St. Augustin and
St. Monica, which constituted the right attack. At San
Engracia they laboured on a line perpendicular to the
Cosso, from which they were separated only by the large
convent of the daughters of Jerusalem, and by the hospital
for madmen, which was entrenched, although in
ruins since the first siege. The line of this attack was
protected on the left by the convent of the Capuchins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which General Lacoste had fortified to repel the counter&ndash;assaults
of the Spaniards. The right attack was more
diffused, because the localities presented less prominent
features to determine the direction of the approaches:
and the French, having mounted a number of light six&ndash;inch
mortars on peculiar carriages, drew them from street
to street, and from house to house, as occasion offered.
On the other hand, the Spaniards continually plied their
enemies with hand&ndash;grenades, which seem to have produced
a surprising effect, and in this manner the never&ndash;ceasing
combat was prolonged until the 7th of February,
when the besiegers, by dint of alternate mines and
assaults, had worked their perilous way at either attack
to the Cosso, but not without several changes of fortune
and considerable loss. They were, however, unable to
obtain a footing on that public walk, for the Spaniards
still disputed every house with undiminished resolution.</p>

<p>“The 8th, 9th, and 10th were wasted by the besiegers
in vain attempts to pass the Cosso; they then extended
their flanks. * * * The 11th and 12th, mines were
worked under the University, a large building on the
Spanish side of the Cosso, in the line of the right
attack; but their play was insufficient to open the walls,
and the storming party was beaten with the loss of fifty
men. Nevertheless, the besiegers continuing their
labours during the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th,
passed the Cosso by means of traverses, and prepared
fresh mines under the University, but deferred their
explosion until a simultaneous effort could be combined
on the side of the suburb.</p>

<p>“At the left attack also a number of houses bordering
on the Cosso being gained, a battery was established that
raked that great thoroughfare above ground; while under
it, six galleries were carried, and six mines loaded to
explode at the same moment; but the spirit of the
French army was now exhausted; they had laboured
and fought without intermission for fifty days; they had
crumbled the walls with their bullets, burst the convents
with their mines, and carried the walls with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
bayonets. Fighting above and beneath the surface of
the earth, they had spared neither fire nor the sword;
their bravest men were falling in the obscurity of a subterranean
warfare; famine pinched them, and Zaragoza
was still unconquered!</p>

<p>“‘Before this siege,’ they exclaimed, ‘was it ever
heard that 20,000 men should besiege 50,000?’ Scarcely
a fourth of the town was won, and they themselves were
already exhausted. ‘We must wait,’ they said, ‘for
reinforcements, or we shall all perish among these cursed
ruins, which will become our own tombs before we
can force the last of these fanatics from the last of their
dens.’</p>

<p>“Marshal Lasnes, unshaken by these murmurs and
obstinate to conquer, endeavoured to raise the soldiers’
hopes. He pointed out to them that the losses of the
besieged so far exceeded their own, that the Spaniards’
strength must soon be wasted, and their courage must
sink, and that the fierceness of their defence was already
abated; but if, contrary to expectation, they should
renew the example of Numantia, their utter destruction
must quickly ensue from the combined effects of battle,
misery, and pestilence.</p>

<p>“These exhortations succeeded, and on the 18th, all
the combinations being complete, a general assault took
place. The French at the right attack having opened a
party wall by the explosion of a petard, made a sudden
rush through some burning ruins, and carried without a
check the island of houses leading down to the quay,
with the exception of two buildings. The Spaniards
were thus forced to abandon all the external fortifications
between St. Augustin and the Ebro, which they had
preserved until that day. And while this assault was in
progress, the mines under the university, containing
3000 pounds of powder, were sprung; and the walls
tumbling with a terrific crash, a column of the besiegers
entered the place, and after one repulse secured a lodgment.
During this time fifty pieces of artillery thundered
upon the suburb, and ploughed up the bridge over the
Ebro, and by mid&ndash;day opened a practicable breach in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
great convent of St. Lazar, which was the principal
defence on that side. Lasnes, observing that the
Spaniards seemed to be shaken by this overwhelming
fire, immediately ordered an assault, and St. Lazar being
carried forthwith, all retreat to the bridge was thus
intercepted, and the besieged falling into confusion, and
their commander, Baron Versage, being killed, were all
destroyed or taken, with the exception of two or three
hundred men, who, braving the terrible fire to which
they were exposed, got back into the town. General
Gazan immediately occupied the abandoned works, and
having thus cut off above 2000 men that were stationed
on the Ebro, above the suburb, forced them also to
surrender.</p>

<p>“This important success being followed on the 19th
by another fortunate attack on the right bank of the
Ebro, and by the devastating explosion of 1600 pounds
of powder, the constancy of the besieged was at last
shaken. An aide&ndash;de&ndash;camp of Palafox came forth to
demand certain terms, before offered by the Marshal,
adding thereto that the garrison should be allowed to
join the Spanish armies, and that a certain number of
covered carriages should follow them. Lasnes rejected
these proposals, and the fire continued; but the hour of
surrender was come. Fifty pieces of artillery, on the
left bank of the Ebro, laid the houses on the quay in
ruins. The church of Our Lady of the Pillar, under
whose especial protection the city was supposed to exist,
was nearly effaced by the bombardment; and the six
mines under the Cosso, loaded with many thousand
pounds of powder, were ready for a simultaneous explosion,
which would have laid a quarter of the remaining
houses in the dust. In fine, war had done its work, and
the misery of Zaragoza could no longer be endured.</p>

<p>“The bombardment, which had never ceased from
the 10th of January, had forced the women and children
to take refuge in the vaults, with which the city
abounded. There the constant combustion of oil, the
closeness of the atmosphere, unusual diet, and fear and
restlessness of mind, had combined to produce a pestilence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
which soon spread to the garrison. The strong
and weak, the daring soldier and the timid child, fell
before it alike; and such was the state of the atmosphere,
and the disposition to disease, that the slightest wound
gangrened and became incurable. In the beginning of
February the deaths were from four to five hundred
daily; the living were unable to bury the dead, and
thousands of carcases scattered about the streets and
court&ndash;yards, or piled in heaps at the doors of the
churches, were left to dissolve in their own corruption,
or to be licked up by the flames of the burning houses as
the defence became contracted.</p>

<p>“The suburb, the greatest part of the walls, and one&ndash;fourth
of the houses were in the hands of the French;
16,000 shells thrown during the bombardment, and the
explosion of 45,000 pounds of powder in the mines, had
shaken the city to its foundations, and the bones of more
than 40,000 persons of every age and sex bore dreadful
testimony to the constancy of the besieged.</p>

<p>“Palafox was sick; and of the plebeian chiefs, the
most distinguished having been slain in battle, or swept
away by the pestilence, the obdurate violence of the
remaining leaders was so abated that a fresh junta was
formed; and, after a stormy consultation, the majority
being for a surrender, a deputation waited on Marshal
Lasnes on the 20th of February to negotiate a capitulation.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Some doubt exists as to the terms obtained; the French
writers assert that the place surrendered at discretion;
the Spaniards say the following conditions were obtained:
that the garrison should march out with the honours of
war, to be constituted prisoners and marched to France;
the peasants to be sent home, and property and religion
to be guaranteed. On the 21st, from 12,000 to 15,000
sickly men laid down the arms which they could
scarcely support, and this memorable siege was terminated.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">Corcyrean sedition—Civil wars of Rome—Jacquerie—Factions
of the Circus at Constantinople—Massacre of Sept.
2, 1792.</p>

<p class="pn">The year which witnessed the unhappy fate of the brave
Platæans was made remarkable by the Corcyrean sedition
also: on which, as on the plague of Athens, the
pen of Thucydides has conferred a lasting celebrity.</p>

<p>Corcyra, an island situated on the western coast of
Greece, by sedulous attention to commerce, had risen, a
little before the Peloponnesian war, to the possession of
a navy capable of rivalling in strength that of any Grecian
state, except Athens. It was a colony of Corinth;
but, in consequence of some disputes which arose out of
the affairs of Epidamnus, a Corcyrean colony, war broke
out between Corcyra and the mother country, the Corcyreans
concluded a defensive alliance with the
Athenians, and the democratical interest was of course
established in power. A naval battle ensued, in which
the Corinthians had the advantage, and took upwards of
a thousand prisoners. It rarely happened in any of the
smaller Grecian states, that either the democratic or the
oligarchical party obtained an uncontested and permanent
ascendancy; and the Corinthians were not inclined to
resign without a struggle that respect and influence
which the manners and religion of Greece taught to be
due from the colony to the mother country. Of the
prisoners above mentioned, eight hundred, who were
slaves, were sold by the victors; the rest, to the number
of two hundred and fifty, were citizens, most of them
men of consequence in Corcyra, who probably looked
with no friendly eye on the Athenian alliance, and at all
events were ready to break it off, and revert to the connexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of Corinth, as the price of their liberty. They
were accordingly suffered to return home. The tumults
to which their subsequent attempts to restore the oligarchy
gave rise are celebrated in history under the
name of the Corcyrean sedition. A more heinous scene
of treachery and murder has seldom been exhibited even
in civil warfare; or a more deplorable state of morals
described than that which is said by Thucydides in the
following passage to have prevailed, not only in Corcyra,
but throughout Greece.</p>

<p>“The sedition in Corcyra began upon the coming
home of those captives which were taken in the battles
by sea at Epidamnus, and released afterwards by the
Corinthians at the ransom, as was voiced, of eight
hundred talents, for which they had given security to
their hosts,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> but in fact, because they had persuaded
the Corinthians that they would put Corcyra into their
power. These persons going round from man to man,
solicited the city to revolt from the Athenians; and two
galleys being now come in, one of Athens, another of
Corinth, with ambassadors from both those states, the
Corcyreans, upon audience of them both, decreed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hold the Athenians for their confederates, on articles
agreed on: but withal to remain friends to the Peloponnesians,
as they had formerly been. There was one
Pithias, voluntary host of the Athenians, and that had
been principal magistrate of the people. Him these
men called into judgment, and laid to his charge a practice
to bring the city into the servitude of the Athenians.
He again, being acquit, called in question five of the
wealthiest of the same men, saying they had cut certain
stakes<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in the ground belonging to the temples both of
Jupiter and of Alcinous, upon every one of which there
lay a penalty of a stater.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> And being sentenced to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the fine, they took sanctuary in the temples, to the end,
the sum being great, they might pay it by portions, as
they should be taxed. But Pithias (for he was also of
the senate) obtained that the law should proceed. These
five being by the law shut out of hope, and understanding
that Pithias, as long as he was a senator, would
cause the people to hold for friends and foes the same
that were so to the Athenians, conspired with the rest,
and armed with daggers, suddenly brake into the senate
house, and slew both Pithias and others, as well private
men as senators, to the number of about sixty persons;
only a few of those of Pithias his faction escaped into
the Athenian galley that lay yet in the harbour.</p>

<p>“When they had done this, and called the Corcyreans
to an assembly, they told them, that what they
had done was for the best, and that they should not be
now in bondage to the Athenians. And for the future
they advised them to be in quiet, and to receive neither
party with more than one galley at once; and to take
them for enemies if they were more: and when they
had spoken forced them to decree it accordingly. They
also presently sent ambassadors to Athens, both to show
that it was fit for them to do what they had done, and
also to dissuade such Corcyreans as were fled thither of
the other faction, from doing anything to their prejudice,
lest there should be a counter&ndash;revolution.</p>

<p>“When these arrived, the Athenians apprehended
both the ambassadors themselves, as seditious persons,
and also all those Corcyreans whom they had there
prevailed with, and sent them to custody in Ægina. In
the mean time, upon the coming in of a galley of Corinth
with ambassadors from Lacedæmon, that party that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the rule assailed the commons, and overcame them in
fight; and night coming on, the commons fled into the
citadel, and the higher parts of the city, where they
rallied themselves and encamped, and made themselves
masters of the haven called the Hillaic haven. But the
others seized on the market&ndash;place (where also the most of
them dwelt) and on the haven on the side toward the
continent.</p>

<p>“The next day they skirmished a little with shot,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and both parts sent abroad into the villages to solicit the
slaves, with promise of liberty, to take their parts; and
the greatest part of the slaves took part with the commons,
and the other side had an aid of 800 men from the
continent.</p>

<p>“The next day but one they fought again, and the
people had the victory, having the odds both in strength
of places, and in number of men. And the women also
manfully assisted them, throwing tiles from the houses,
and enduring the tumult, even beyond the condition of
their sex. The few began to fly about twilight, and
fearing lest the people should attack, and at the first onset
gain possession of the arsenal, and put them to the
sword, to stop their passage, set fire to the houses in the
market&ndash;place, and those adjoining them, sparing neither
their own property nor others. Much goods of merchants
were hereby burnt, and the whole city, if the
wind had risen and carried the flame that way, had been
in danger to have been destroyed. Then ceasing from
battle, forasmuch as both parties were at rest, they set
watch for the night. And the Corinthian galley stole
away, because the people had gotten the victory, and
most of the auxiliaries got over privily to the continent.</p>

<p>“The next day Nicostratus the son of Diotrephes, an
Athenian commander, came in with twelve galleys and
five hundred Messenian men of arms from Naupactus,
and both negotiated a reconciliation, and induced them
(to the end they might agree) to condemn ten of the
principal authors of the sedition (who presently fled)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and to let the rest alone, with articles both between
themselves and with the Athenians, to esteem friends
and enemies the same as the Athenians did. When he
had done this, he would have been gone, but the people
persuaded him before he went to leave behind him five
of his galleys, the better to keep their adversaries from
stirring, and to take as many of theirs, which they would
man with Corcyreans, and send with him. To this he
agreed, and they made a list of those that should embark,
consisting altogether of their enemies. But these fearing
to be sent to Athens, took sanctuary in the temple
of Castor and Pollux: but Nicostratus endeavoured to
raise them, and spake to them, to put them into courage:
but when he could not prevail, the people (arming themselves
on pretence that their diffidence to go along with
Nicostratus proceeded from some evil intention) took
away their arms out of their houses, and would also have
killed some of them, such as they chanced on, if Nicostratus
had not hindered them. Others also, when they
saw this, took sanctuary in the temple of Juno, and they
were in all above four hundred. But the people, fearing
some innovation, got them by persuasion to rise, and
conveying them into the island that lieth over against
the temple of Juno, sent them their necessaries thither.</p>

<p>“The sedition standing in these terms, the fourth or
fifth day after the putting over of these men into the
island, arrived the Peloponnesian fleet from Cyllene,
where, since their voyage of Ionia, they had lain at anchor,
to the number of three and fifty sail. Alcidas had
the command of these, as before, and Brasidas came
with him as a counsellor. And having first put in at
Sybota, a haven of the continent, they came on the next
morning by break of day toward Corcyra.</p>

<p>“The Corcyreans being in a great tumult and fear,
both of the seditious within, and of the invasion without,
made ready threescore galleys, and still as any of them
were manned, sent them out against the enemy; whereas
the Athenians had advised them to give leave to them
to go forth first, and then the Corcyreans to follow after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with the whole fleet together. But when their scattered
ships neared the enemy, two of them immediately deserted,
and in others they that were aboard went together
by the oars, and nothing was done in due order. The
Peloponnesians, seeing their confusion, opposed themselves
to the Corcyreans with twenty galleys only, the
rest they set in array against the twelve galleys of
Athens.</p>

<p>“The Corcyreans having come disorderly up, and by
few at once, were of their own fault in much distress;
but the Athenians, fearing an overmatch of numbers,
and that they should be surrounded, did not charge
upon the close array, nor on the centre of the enemy;
but attacked the wing, and sunk one of their galleys:
and when the Peloponnesians afterwards had put their
fleet into a circular figure, they then went about and
about it, endeavouring to put them into disorder; which
they that were fighting against the Corcyreans perceiving,
and fearing such another chance as befel them formerly
at Naupactus, went to their aid, and uniting themselves,
came upon the Athenians all together. But they,
backing their oars, retreated with their prows to the
enemy, that the Corcyreans should take that time to
escape in; they themselves in the mean time going as
leisurely back as was possible, and keeping the enemy
still opposed to them. Such was this battle, and it ended
about sunset.</p>

<p>“The Corcyreans fearing lest the enemy, in pursuit
of their victory, should have come directly against the
city, or take aboard the men which they had put over
into the island, or do them some other mischief, fetched
back the men into the temple of Juno again, and
guarded the city. But the Peloponnesians, though they
had won the battle, yet durst not invade the city, but
having taken thirteen of the Corcyrean galleys, went
back into the continent from whence they had set
forth. The next day they came not unto the city, no
more than before, although it was in great tumult and
affright: and though also Brasidas (as it is reported)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
advised Alcidas to it, but had not equal authority: but
only landed soldiers at the promontory of Leucimna, and
wasted their territory.</p>

<p>“In the mean time the people of Corcyra, fearing
extremely lest those galleys should come against the
city, not only conferred with those in sanctuary, and
with the rest, about how the city might be preserved,
but also induced some of them to serve on shipboard.
For notwithstanding the confusion they had still manned
thirty galleys, in expectation that the fleet of the enemy
should have entered. But the Peloponnesians having
been wasting of their fields till it was about noon, went
their ways again. And during the night the Corcyreans
had notice by beacon&ndash;fires of threescore Athenian galleys
coming toward them from Leucas, which the Athenians,
upon intelligence of the sedition, and of the fleet
to go to Corcyra under Alcidas, had sent to aid them,
under the conduct of Eurymedon the son of Thucles.</p>

<p>“The Peloponnesians, therefore, as soon as night
came, sailed speedily home, keeping still the shore, and
causing their galleys to be carried over at the Isthmus
of Leucas, that they might not come in sight as they
doubled it. But the people of Corcyra, hearing of the
Attic galleys coming in, and the going off of the Peloponnesians,
brought into the city the Messenians,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> who
till this time had been kept outside the walls, and appointing
the galleys which they had equipped to come
about into the Hillaic haven; they in the mean time
slew all the contrary faction they could lay hands on,
and also afterwards threw overboard out of the same
galleys all those (i. e., of the oligarchical party) they had
before persuaded to embark, and so went thence. And
coming to the temple of Juno, they persuaded fifty of
those that had taken sanctuary, to refer themselves to a
legal trial; all which they condemned to die. But
most of those who had taken sanctuary, that is, all those
that were not induced to stand to trial by law, when
they saw what was done, killed one another there, right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in the temple: some hanged themselves on trees; every
one, as he had means, made himself away. And for
seven days together that Eurymedon staid there with his
threescore galleys, the Corcyreans did nothing but kill
such of their city as they took to be their enemies, laying
to their charge indeed that they had conspired against
the commons, but some among them were slain upon
private hatred, and some by their debtors, for the money
which they had lent them. All forms of death were
then seen, and (as in such cases it usually falls out)
whatsoever had happened at any time, happened also
then, and more. For the father slew his son, men were
dragged out of the temples, and then slain hard by; and
some walled up within the temple of Bacchus<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> died
there. So cruel was this sedition; and it seemed so the
more, because it was among these men the first.</p>

<p>“For afterwards all Greece, as a man may say, was
in commotion; and quarrels arose every where between
the patrons of the commons, that sought to bring in the
Athenians, and the Few<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> that desired to bring in the
Lacedæmonians. Now in time of peace they could have
no pretence, nor would have been so forward to call
them in; but being war, and confederates to be had for
either party, both to hurt their enemies, and strengthen
themselves, such as desired alteration easily got foreign
help to their end. And many heinous things happened
in the cities through this sedition, which though they
have been before, and shall be ever, as long as human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
nature is the same, yet they are more violent, or more
tranquil, and of different kinds, according to the several<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
conjunctures at which they occur. For in peace and
prosperity both cities and private men are better minded,
because they fall not into such emergencies as constrain
men to do things, whether they will or no; but war
taking away the affluence of daily necessaries, is a most
violent master, and conformeth most men’s passions to
the present occasion. So sedition prevailed in the cities,
and those that fell into it later, having heard what had
been done in the former, far exceeded them in newness
of conceit, both for the art of assailing, and for the
strangeness of their revenges. The received value of
names imposed for signification of things, was changed
into arbitrary: for inconsiderate boldness was counted
true&ndash;hearted manliness; provident deliberation, a handsome
fear; modesty, the cloak of cowardice; to be wise
in every thing, to be lazy in every thing. A furious
suddenness was reputed a point of valour. To re&ndash;advise
for the better security, was held for a fair pretext of
tergiversation. He that was fierce, was always trusty;
and he that contraried such a one, was suspected. He
that did insidiate, if he took, was a wise man; but he
that could find out the trap, a cleverer man than he: but
he that had been so provident as not to need to do one
or the other, was said to be a dissolver of fellowship, and
one that stood in fear of his adversary. In brief, he that
could outstrip another in the doing of an evil act, or that
could persuade another thereto, that never meant it, was
commended. To be kin to another, was not to be so near as
to be of his fellowship, because these were ready to undertake
any thing, without standing upon pretexts. For these
fellowships<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> looked not to benefits consistent with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
existing laws, but to self&ndash;aggrandizement, contrary to
them. And as for mutual trust amongst them, it was
confirmed not so much by divine law,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> as by the communication
of guilt. And what was handsomely spoken
by their adversaries, they received with an eye to their
actions, to see whether they were too strong for them
or not, and not ingenuously. To be revenged was in
more request, than never to have received injury. And
oaths of reconcilement (if any were) given by one to
another, because in the present conjuncture they could
do nought else, were binding, as long as the parties had
no power otherwise; but upon opportunity, he that first
durst, if he saw an unguarded place, thought his revenge
sweeter by the trust than if he had taken the
open way. And this course was valued both for its
security, and because he that circumvented his adversary
by fraud assumed to himself withal a mastery in point
of wit. And dishonest men for the most part are sooner
called able, than simple men honest. And men are
ashamed of this title, but take a pride in the other. The
cause of this is desire of rule, out of avarice and ambition,
and the zeal of contention<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> from those two proceeding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
For such as were of authority in the cities, both
of the one and the other faction, the one under the decent
pretext of political equality of the many, the other of
moderate aristocracy, though in words they seemed to
be servants of the public, they made it in effect but the
prize of their contention. And striving by whatsoever
means to overcome, both ventured on most horrible
outrages, and revenged them even beyond the provocations,
without any regard of justice, or the public good,
but limiting them, each faction, by their own appetite:
and stood ready, whether by unjust sentence, or with
their own hands, when they should get the uppermost,
to satisfy their spite. So that neither side thought to
do any thing by honest means; but they were best
spoken of, that could pass a business though against the
grain, with fair words. The neutrals of the city were
destroyed by both factions; partly because they would
not side with them, and partly for envy that they should
so escape.</p>

<p>“Thus was wickedness on foot in every kind, throughout
all Greece, by the occasion of the party conflicts.
Sincerity (whereof there is much in a generous nature)
was laughed down, and vanished. And it was far the
best course to stand distrustfully against each other, for
neither were words powerful, nor oaths terrible enough
to assure reconciliation. And being all of them, the
more they considered, the more desperate of security,
they rather contrived how to avoid a mischief, than
were able to rely on any man’s faith. And for the most
part such as had the least wit had the best success; for
both their own defect, and the subtilty of their adversaries,
putting them in a great fear to be overcome in words,
or at least in pre&ndash;insidiation, by their enemies’ great craft,
they therefore went roundly to work with them, with
deeds. Whereas the other, thinking in their arrogance
that they should be aware in time, and that they needed
not to take by force what they might do by plot, were
thereby unprovided, and so the more easily slain.</p>

<p>“In Corcyra then were most of these evils committed
first: and besides these, all that men might perpetrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in retaliation, who had been tyrannically governed by
that very party which they now saw in their power; or
that men just freed from their accustomed poverty, and
greedily coveting their neighbour’s goods, would against
justice agree to; or which men, assailing each other,
not upon desire of gain, but as equal against equal, in
the intemperance of anger would cruelly and inexorably
execute. And the common course of life being at that
time confounded in the city, the nature of man, which is
wont even against law to do evil, gotten now above the
law, was very ready to display itself as intemperately
passionate, too strong for justice, and an enemy to all
superiority. For they would never else have preferred
revenge to sanctity, and gain to that condition of justice,
in which envy would have lost its power to do harm.
And for the laws common to all men in such cases
(which, as long as they be in force, give hope to all
that suffer injury), men desire not to leave them standing,
against the need a man in danger may have of them,
but by their revenges on others, to be beforehand in
subverting them.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>“Such were the passions of the Corcyreans first of all
other Grecians, towards one another in the city. And
Eurymedon and the Athenians departed with their galleys.
Afterwards such of the Corcyreans as had fled
(for there escaped about five hundred of them) having
seized on the forts in the continent, established themselves
in their own territory on the mainland opposite the
island, and from thence came over and robbed the
islanders, and did them much hurt; and there grew a
great famine in the city. They likewise sent ambassadors
to Lacedæmon and Corinth, to negotiate concerning their
return; and when they could get nothing done, having
gotten boats, and some auxiliary soldiers, they passed a
while after to the number of about six hundred into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
island. Where when they had set their boats on fire,
that they might have no hope but in the making themselves
masters of the country, they went up into the
hill Istone, and having there fortified themselves with a
wall, infested those within, and were masters of the territory.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>“In the seventh year of the war<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Eurymedon and
Sophocles, after their departure from Pylus with the
Athenian fleet towards Sicily, arriving at Corcyra, joined
with those of the city, and made war upon those Corcyreans
which lay encamped upon the hill Istone, and
which, after the sedition, had come over, and made
themselves masters of the country, and done much harm:
and having assaulted their fortification, took it. But the
men all in one troop escaped to a certain high ground,
and thence made their composition, which was this;
‘that they should deliver up the foreigners that aided
them; and that they themselves, having rendered their
arms, should stand to the judgment of the people of
Athens.’ Hereupon the generals granted them truce,
and transported them to the island of Ptychia, to be
there in custody till the Athenians should send for
them; with this condition, ‘that if any one of them
should be taken running away, then the truce to be
broken for them all.’ But the leaders of the commons
of Corcyra, fearing lest the Athenians would not kill
those who were sent to them, devise against them this
plot. To some few of those in the island they secretly
send their friends, and instruct them to say, as if forsooth,
it were for good will, that it was their best course
with all speed to get away (and withal to offer to provide
them of a boat), for that the Athenian commanders
intended verily to deliver them to the Corcyrean
people.</p>

<p>“When they were persuaded to do so, and that a
boat was treacherously prepared, as they rowed away
they were taken, and the truce being now broken, were
all given up into the hands of the Corcyreans. It did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
much further this plot, by giving to the pretence held
out an appearance of reality, and making the agents in
it less fearful, that the Athenian generals evidently did
not wish the men to be carried home by others, whilst
they themselves were to go into Sicily, and the honour
of it be ascribed to those that should convoy them. The
Corcyreans having received them into their hands, imprisoned
them in a large edifice, from whence afterwards
they took them out by twenty at a time, and made them
pass through a lane of men of arms, bound together, and
receiving strokes and thrusts from those on either side,
according as any one espied his enemy. And to hasten
the pace of those that went slowliest on, others were set
to follow them with whips.</p>

<p>“They had taken out of the room in this manner,
and slain, to the number of threescore, before they that
remained knew it, who thought they were but removed,
and carried to some other place. But when they knew
the truth, some or other having told them, they then
cried out to the Athenians, and bid them, if they wished
their death, kill them themselves; and refused any more
to go out of the building, nor would suffer, they said, as
long as they were able, any man to come in. But neither
had the Corcyreans any purpose to force entrance by
the door, but getting up to the top of the house, uncovered
the roof, and threw tiles, and shot arrows at them.
They in prison defended themselves as well as they
could; but many also slew themselves with the arrows
shot by the enemy, by thrusting them into their throats,
and strangling themselves with the cords of certain beds
that were in the room, and with halters made of their
own garments rent in pieces. And having continued
most part of the night (for night overtook them in the
action), partly strangling themselves by all such means
as they found, and partly shot at from above, they all
perished. When day came, the Corcyreans laid them
one across another<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in carts, and carried them out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the city. And of their wives, as many as were taken in
the fortification, they made bond&ndash;women. In this
manner were the Corcyreans that kept the hill,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> brought
to destruction by the commons. And thus ended this
far&ndash;spread sedition, for so much as concerned this present
war: for other seditions there remained nothing
worth the relation.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more thoroughly hateful
state of society than that which appears from this passage,
and from the description of the plague of Athens,
to have existed in Greece at this period. The picture,
it is to be remembered, comes to us on the authority of
one whose impartiality and deep powers of observation
are alike unquestioned, no splenetic, no visionary, but
one who had mixed largely and in high station among
the stirring times of which he writes. The most astonishing
circumstance connected with the depravity here
exhibited, is the short period in which it appears to
have shot up into such rank growth. We possess, it is
true, little knowledge of any thing but the public acts
of Greece anterior to the Peloponnesian war, at which
time the contemporary historian, and still more the contemporary
comedian Aristophanes, supply us with
abundant notices of private life, which are continued
and enlarged by the philosophers and orators. Still, as
far as we have the means of judging, there seems no
reason to ascribe to the Greeks, until about the Peloponnesian
war, a smaller share of morality and religion than
has usually been found among heathen nations. Whence
then in so short a time this utter loss of moral sense and
disruption of the bonds of society? The question is
not an easy one to answer, but the substance of the best
answer that we can give is comprised in the introductory
chapter to this volume.</p>

<p>To supply a series of parallels to this domestic contest
is scarcely possible. Among insurrections and civil
wars, events of equal atrocity and more astounding magnitude
might be found, but scarcely events of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
character. We naturally turn first to the other great
nation of antiquity. Here we are warned against the
most obvious comparison by a late eminent scholar.
After speaking of the dangers incident to the
struggle between the aristocracy and the people in
that often&ndash;occurring form of a nation’s early existence,
when it is divided into a privileged race or caste, whose
power is founded on conquest, and a commonalty personally
free, but politically dependant, as were the
Saxons, while the distinction between Saxon and Norman
blood continued in England; after speaking of the
dangers which beset that contest which is sure to take
place when the spread of wealth and knowledge has
equalized the personal qualities of the rulers and the
ruled, he continues: “If the nation escapes these, either
originally or finally, it enters upon its state of manhood,
and is exposed to a somewhat different succession of
struggles. The contest is then between property and
numbers, and wherever it has come to a crisis, I know
not that it has in any instance terminated favourably.
Such was the state of Greece in the time of Thucydides;
of Rome from the passing of the Publilian laws to the
end of the commonwealth: and such has been the state
of England since the Revolution of 1688. Comparisons
drawn from the preceding period are inapplicable to
this; while on the other hand, as the phenomena of this
second period arise out of causes connected with the
earlier state of things, they cannot be clearly understood
unless that former state be fully known to us. Thus, to
argue that the Romans were less bloody than the Greeks
from a comparison between the factions of the Peloponnesian
war, and the struggles of the Roman commons
against the patricians, is to compare the two nations
under very different circumstances; it is instituting a
comparison between the intensity of our passions in manhood
and in childhood. The bloody factions of Corcyra
and Megara are analogous to the civil wars of Marius
and Sylla, of Cæsar and Pompey, of Brutus and Cassius
against the Triumvirs: the harmless contests between
the commons and patricians can only be compared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
those which prevailed in Greece before the Persian invasion,
when the party of the coast at Athens was disputing
the exclusive ascendency so long enjoyed by the
eupatridæ or party of the plain.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> And the true conclusion
is, that the second contest between property and
numbers is far more inevitably accompanied by atrocious
crimes, than that earlier quarrel, in which property and
numbers were united against property and birth.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The Corcyrean sedition differed from the secession to
the Mons Sacer, and other disputes between patricians
and plebeians, in being a struggle of parties, not ranks.
Very little positive information concerning the constitution
of the island has been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Originally,
probably, its Corinthian colonists established an oligarchy:
but the prosecution of maritime affairs was always
held greatly to favour the ascendency of the people, and
in Thucydides we find no trace of a privileged body of
citizens at Corcyra any more than at Athens. When
speaking of the 250, whom the Corinthians selected as a
sort of hostages to regain their influence, he calls them,
“for the most part the first men of the city in power.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Elsewhere he describes them as “those in possession of
things,” or “the few,”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> but not as the magistracy, or in
terms which lead us to suppose that they formed a constitutional
aristocracy either of birth or wealth. This,
therefore, was a branch of the great struggle which gave
its character to the whole Peloponnesian war, whether
the oligarchical principle, under the patronage of Lacedæmon,
or the democratic under the patronage of
Athens, should reign in Greece. The co&ndash;existence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the two in peace seems, from the restless and intriguing
temper of the people, to have been impossible; and the
experience of other cities had shown that for the worsted
party there was no security but in flight, attended
usually by sentence of exile and confiscation. And there
is no authority to which men submit so reluctantly, no
hardships which they feel so keenly, as those which arise
from the elevation of their former equals. The circumstances
of the times, therefore, combined with the
spreading moral pestilence to give a desperation to this
contest, from which the early dissensions of patricians
and plebeians, happily for Rome, were free. Here
each party had a definite object to contend for; the one,
the relaxation of oppressive privileges; the other, to
maintain unimpaired the immunities and dignity of their
order: and each had wisdom, the one to be moderate in
its demands; the other to concede moderately, rather
than hazard the very being of the state by an appeal to
arms. No personal or political hatred inflamed the
passions, unless where some enslaved debtor was maddened
by suffering, or some hot&ndash;headed patrician, such
as the old legends of Rome represented Coriolanus to be,
became impatient that the swinish multitude should
believe they had rights; each party felt that the other
was necessary to its welfare, and though driven to violence,
the plebeians still looked up with respect and
affection to their hereditary aristocracy.</p>

<p>As these disturbances belong to an earlier, so the
civil wars of Marius and Sylla, and those which ended
in the establishment of the Empire, belong, we think, to a
more advanced stage of society than does the Corcyrean
sedition, which is compared to them in the foregoing
quotation. Rome had reached, and had passed the
period at which a true democracy becomes impossible except
through the medium of representation; while at
Corcyra, even when the popular faction was supreme,
the government was an oligarchy, in respect of the <i>whole</i>
population of the state, of which slaves and foreigners
constituted, we may presume, a considerable majority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
The legislative and the armed body were identical;
a part of that body might triumph over the rest, but no
one could mount on the shoulders of the people to a
military despotism, and then kick away the step by
which he had risen. No leader seems to have risen to
the absolute power of Marius, or Sylla, or Cæsar; if
there had, it must have been by consent of the prevailing
party, who would therefore have been implicated in his
actions. At Rome the case was very different: the legislative
authority centred in the resident citizens, the
military power of the state was more than equally shared
with them by the provincial armies, composed partly of
barbarians, partly of subjects of the state, entitled to a
greater or lesser share of the privileges of citizenship,
but not to vote in the assemblies of the people, and
partly, it is true, of citizens, but those long absent from
the seat of government, and careless about politics, but
devoted to the leader who had led them on to plunder,
honour, and victory. Some faction therefore was to be
courted to gain place and power, but he who had gained
them, and with them military command and influence,
was in great measure independent of his former associates.
Sylla and Marius were terrible to friends as well
as foes, and it would be unfair to charge upon the Roman
people the enormous crimes committed under the military
tyrannies which they established.</p>

<p>If we look for parallels in modern history, the search
will not be more successful. The domestic quarrels as
well as the structure of the Italian states, bear a close
analogy to those of the Greek republics, and the contests
of the oligarchical and democratic parties, and the influence
of Sparta or Athens, as one or the other
prevailed, may be closely exemplified by the bitter
quarrels of the Guelphs and Ghibelines, and the interest
exerted, by means of these parties, by the Pope and
the Emperor. But full as is Italian history of desperate
feuds, we cannot call to mind any one worthy to be compared
with the transactions at Corcyra. The massacre,
called the Sicilian Vespers, when 8000 French were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
surprised and slain in one night, by a simultaneous insurrection
of the native Sicilians, is a memorable and frightful
example of popular revenge: but the act of a people
rising in defence of its rights, atrocious as is such a
method of asserting them, is not to be placed by the side
of so cold&ndash;blooded, and unprovoked, and faithless a
massacre as that of the conquered Corcyreans. The
massacre of St. Bartholomew might compete with it in
point of treachery, but the ground of quarrel, and the
relation of the contending parties, were entirely dissimilar.</p>

<p>The outrages committed in France by the insurgent
peasantry, called Jacquerie, are unlike the massacres at
Corcyra, inasmuch as they belong to an earlier stage of
society, a stage again different from that contemplated
by Dr. Arnold, when he speaks of the harmless nature
of that earlier quarrel in which property and numbers
are united against property and birth. These risings,
and the corresponding risings in England, were the acts
of men without property, and many of them without a
legal capability of acquiring it; men hostile to all the
institutions of society, because to them society had been
little but an engine of oppression. They were the efforts
of brute force against all that is superior to itself; the
rage of the untamed wolf after he has broken his chain.
We say this not in justification of the conduct of their
feudal lords, nor in censure of their earnest desire to
break the yoke which bore them down to the ground.
But whether their cause was good or bad, the method of
their advocating it was brutal; and herein servile wars,
if not most formidable as to their result, are most to be
deprecated, because the passions of each party are sure
to be exasperated to the uttermost: and because the insurgents,
being without the pale of the laws of war, have
no temptation to show mercy, and no hope but in victory.
And so to the Jacquerie, every thing more
refined or exalted than themselves was the object of
their deadly hate. They had no thought to raise themselves;
that was beyond the grasp of their minds: but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
they were bent on pulling down others to their own
level, so that distinctions the most inoffensive or laudable
were as odious to them as the rank and power which had
been misused to the oppression of the commonalty.
“Be it known unto thee by these presence, even the
presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom that
must sweep the court clear of such filth as thou art.
Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the
realm in erecting a grammar&ndash;school: and whereas, before
our fore&ndash;fathers had no other books but the score
and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be used, and
contrary to the king, his crown, and his dignity, thou
hast built a paper&ndash;mill. It will be proved to thy face
that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun
and a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian
can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed justices of
peace, to call poor men before them about matters that
they were not able to answer. Moreover, thou hast put
them in prison, and because they could not read thou
hast hanged them, when, indeed, only for that cause
they have been most worthy to live.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>This picture is somewhat highly coloured, but if the
reader will consult Holinshed for the account of Wat
Tyler’s rebellion in 1381, he will find that there is good
authority for it. “To recite what was done in every
part of the realme, in time of these hellish troubles, it is
not possible; but this is to be considered, that the rage
of the commons was universallie such, as it might seem
they had generallie conspired together to do what mischeefe
they could devise. As among sundrie other, what
wickednesse was it to compell teachers of children in grammar
schooles to swear never to instruct any in their art!
Again, they could never have a more mischievous meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
than to burn and destroy all old and auncient monuments,
and to murder and despatch out of the way all
such as were able to commit to memorie either any new
or old records. For it was dangerous among them to be
known for one that was learned, and more dangerous if
any man were found with a penner and inkhorn at his
side, for such seldom escaped from them with life.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
The fidelity with which Shakspeare has copied the chronicles
may be readily exemplified from a variety of
passages.</p>

<p class="p1">It is time, however, to proceed to the historical evidence
on which our statements of the excesses of the
Jacquerie are founded.</p>

<p>“Anon (<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1358) there began a marvelouse trybulacion
in the realme of France, for certayne people
of the common villages, without any head or ruler,
assembled togyder in Beauvoisin. In the beginning
they passed nat a hundred in nombre: they sayd how
the noblemen of the realme of Fraunce, knyghtes, and
squyers, shamed the realme, and that it shulde be a grete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
wealth to distroy them all; and eche of them sayd it was
true, and sayd alle with one voice,—Shame have he that
doth nat his power to distroy all the gentylmen of the
realme. Thus they gathered togyder without any other
counsayle, and without any armure, saving with staves
and knyves, and so went to the house of a knyght dwelling
thereby, and brake up his house, and slew the knyght,
and the lady, and all his children, grete and small, and
brent his house: and so dyd they to dyvers other castelles
and good houses. And they multiplied so that
they were a six thousand; and ever as they went forward
they increased, for such lyke as they were fell ever
to them; so that every gentylman fledde fro them, and
took their wyves and chyldren with them, and fledde
x or xx leages off to be in suretie, and left their houses
voyde and their goods therein.—These myschevous people
thus assembled without capitayne or armure, robbed,
brent, and slew all gentylmen that they coude lay handes
on, and forced and ravysshed ladyes and damoselles, and
dyd such shameful dedes, that no humayn creature ought
to think on any such, and he that dyd most mischiefe
was most pleased with them, and greatest maister.—Whan
the gentylmen of Beauvoisin, of Corbois, of Vermandois,
and of other lands whereas these myschevous
people were conversant, saw the woodnesse<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> among
them, they sent for socours to their frendes into Flanders,
to Brabant, to Hainault, and to Bohemia: so there came
fro all partes, and so all these gentylmen straungers assembled
togyder, and dyd sette upon these people wher
they might fynde them, and slew and hanged them
upon trees by heapes. The kynge of Naver on a day
slew of them mo than thre thousand, beside Cleremont in
Beauvoisin. It was time to take them up, for and they had
been all togyder assembled, they were mo than an hundred
thousand, and when they were demanded why they
dyd so yvell dedes, they wolde answer and say, they
could nat tell, but they did as they sawe other do, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
thereby to have distroyed all the nobles and gentylmen
of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>It was the same spirit which somewhat later, in England,
prompted that rebellion of Wat Tyler, of which
we have above spoken. This was a servile war, produced
by oppression and misery; a rising of the serfs
against the nobles, “who hade grete fraunchise over the
commons, and kepeth them in servage, that is to say,
their tenants ought by custom to laboure the lorde’s
landes, to gather and bring home theyr corne, and some
to thrash and to fanne; and by servage to make theyr
hay, and to hew theyr wood, and bring it home: all
these things they ought to do by servage.”——“These
unhappy people beganne to styrre because they were
kept in grete servage; and in the begynning of the
world, they sayd, there were no bondmen; wherefore
they mayntayned that none ought to be bonde, without
he dyd treason to his lorde, as Lucifer dyd to God; but
they sayd they coude have no such batayle, for they
were nouther angels nor spirittes, but men formed
to the similitude of their lordes. Of this imagynacyon
was a folisshe priest of Kent, called Johan Ball, who
wolde oft tymes, on the sondaye after masse, assemble
the people about him, and say thus, A ye good people,
the mater goth nat well to passe in Englande, nor shall
nat do tyll every thing be common; and that there be
no vyllayns nor gentylmen, but that we be all unied
togyder, and that the lordes be no greater maisters
than we be. What have we deserved, or why sholde
we be thus kept in servage? We be all come fro one
father and one mother, Adam and Eve; whereby can
they say or showe that they be gretter lordes than we
be?”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Part of the matter of the priest’s sermon was
well enough, and the cause was good, if its supporters
had been capable of self&ndash;government; but their object
was to establish anarchy, not liberty, and none will be
found hardy enough to regret their failure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>After dwelling so long on things which ought to be
distinguished from the Corcyrean sedition, it is time now,
if ever, to produce those which admit of being compared
with it. We have but two to bring forward: the
second bears a more than usual resemblance to it in respect
of the events which took place; the first bears little resemblance
to it in respect of events, but is distinguished,
if we may trust the contemporary historian, by a forgetfulness
of natural ties, and relaxation of the bonds of
society, very like that described by Thucydides, and not
less worth noticing because the two arose out of entirely
different circumstances, political and other. We allude
to the seditions which tore Constantinople, especially
under the reign of Justinian, ostensibly commencing in
so petty a cause as the superiority of one colour to
another in skill or fortune in the public games, in which
those who contended for prizes, like our jockies, were
distinguished by colours. “The race,” says Gibbon,
“in its first institution, was a simple contest of two
chariots, whose drivers were distinguished by white
and red liveries; two additional colours, a light green
and a cerulean blue, were afterwards introduced, and as
the races were repeated twenty&ndash;five times, one hundred
chariots contributed in the same day to the pomp of the
circus. The four factions soon acquired a legal establishment,
and a mysterious origin, and their fanciful
colours were derived from the various appearances of
nature in the four seasons of the year; the red dogstar
of summer, the snows of winter, the deep shades of
autumn, and the cheerful verdure of the spring. Another
interpretation preferred the elements to the seasons,
and the struggle of the green and blue was supposed to
represent the conflict of the earth and sea. Their respective
victories announced either a plentiful harvest,
or a prosperous navigation, and the hostility of the husbandmen
and mariners was somewhat less absurd than
the blind ardour of the Roman people, who devoted their
lives and fortunes to the colour which they had espoused.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>With the seat of government, the amusements and
the laws of the Roman circus were of course transferred
to Constantinople. Here the mutual jealousy
of the colours soon became combined with political
and theological quarrels, and gave rise to disturbances
which shook some emperors on their thrones, and vitally
affected the peace and welfare of the state. The
historian of the eastern empire has not traced the steps
by which these graver discords became connected with
the badges of amusement. A scholar of our own day has
collected the scattered facts which bear on this question,
but still without furnishing a satisfactory account of
the origin or history of these divisions.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It may indeed
be inferred from a passage in Procopius, which we shall
presently quote, that even in his time no account could
be given or reason be assigned for so preposterous and
blind an enmity. Nor will this surprise any person who
reflects how easily an accidental quarrel is perpetuated
by the adoption of a name or symbol, and how greedily
the vulgar adopt the outward sign of faction, regardless
of the principles which it indicates. Many bloody tumults
and desperate feuds would have been spared to
Ireland if green and orange had never been adopted as
the signs of national and religious hatred; for men would
soon have ceased to care or inquire whether their neighbour
went to church or chapel, had not the insulting
badges of ascendancy and of dissent been continually
paraded before their eyes. Any measure which did
away with the use of party colours at elections would
contribute largely to the quiet and well&ndash;being of England.
Whatever raises an ostensible division between
two classes of society should be sedulously discouraged
by a government. The late Lord Liverpool, according
to a current story, showed his prudence in wearing and
recommending white hats, when that article of dress was
the badge of a party violently opposed to his government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
His intention was answered perfectly, and we
now wear what we please without compromising our political
faith.</p>

<p>Whatever was the origin and progress of the quarrel,
we find in the early part of the sixth century the blue
and green factions inveterately opposed to each other;
the red having merged in the green, and the white in
the blue. In the reign of Anastasius, the greens having
brought concealed weapons into the theatre, massacred
at once 3000 of their blue adversaries. A soldier of
fortune, named Justin, succeeded Anastasius, and was
succeeded by his own nephew, Justinian, during whose
reign the blue faction gained the ascendancy: “A
secret attachment to the family or sect of Anastasius
was imputed to the greens; the blues were zealously
devoted to the cause of orthodoxy and Justinian, and
their grateful patron protected, above five years, the disorders
of a faction, whose seasonable tumults overawed
the palace, the senate, and capitals of the East.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> “In
every city,” says the contemporary Procopius, “the
people are from old time split into two factions, of the
blue and green; but it is not long since this frenzy first
possessed them, that in the cause of these names and
colours in which they appear at the public games, they
will spend their substance, expose their bodies to the
bitterest indignities, and even consent to die by a shameful
death. And while they fight with the opposite
party they cannot tell the nature of their quarrel; being
at the same time aware that even if they get the upper
hand in battle, they will then be led to prison, and suffer
a death of the worst tortures. This hatred of one man
to another springs up without cause; but it remains endless,
yielding neither to the rights of kindred or friendship,
even though brethren, or such near relations, be
partisans of these colours. And so long as their faction
may have the uppermost, they care neither for things
human nor divine, whether there be any impiety offered
towards God, or whether the laws and government be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
violated by friend or enemy. For being themselves
probably in want of common necessaries, they care not
however deeply their country be injured, so long as their
own party is likely to thrive by it. And even women
share in this taint, not merely following their husbands,
but even opposing them (if it shall so chance), though
they go never to the theatres, and are not therefore
excited by any such motives. So that I can call this
nothing better than a disease of the mind.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>“In the Anecdotes, he speaks again, and more fully,
of the excesses committed by the blues under the protection
of Justinian.</p>

<p>“They dressed their hair in a manner new to the
Romans, letting the moustache and beard grow to an
extreme length, like the Persians, while they shaved the
fore part of their heads to the very temples, leaving it
to grow as long and thick as it liked behind, in imitation
of the Massagetæ, after whom they called this the
Hunnish mode. In dress they affected a splendour
beyond their means, defraying the cost at other men’s
expense. Their sleeves were made very close at the
wrist, but up towards the shoulder they spread to an unutterable
breadth.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> So that in the theatre or hippodrome
as often as they moved their hands in shouting, or encouraging
others, as was their custom, they usually
raised the limb to make fools think their bodies so
robust, as that a garment of that size was necessary;
not perceiving that by the emptiness of the garment the
spareness of the body was the more shown. At first they
carried arms, by night openly, and by day wore double&ndash;edged
daggers concealed under their clothes; and
coming out in companies as it grew dark, they stripped
the better sort either in the open market or in passages,
robbing those who fell into their hands of cloaks, golden
brooches, or whatever else it might be. And some they
even killed after robbing them, that they might tell no
tales. By these doings all men were much grieved, and
especially those that were not of the blue faction (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
even they themselves went not scot&ndash;free), and from
thenceforth men wore brass brooches, and girdles and
cloaks beneath their condition.... There was no
known crime which at this time was not committed and
left unpunished. First they only killed their adversaries,
then advancing in guilt they slew those who never
had offended them. Many hired them to take off an
enemy, which they did under pretence that the dead
man was of the green party, though really he were quite
unknown to them. And these things were not done in
darkness as before, but in every hour of the day and
place of the city, and before the eyes of the most
eminent men: for being in no fear of punishment they
cared not for concealment; but rather esteemed it a
glory to those who laid claim to strength and manhood,
that at one blow they could kill any unarmed person who
came across them. In this slippery conjuncture no one
had any hope of surviving; for no place was strong, no
season sacred enough to warrant security; for even in
the most honoured temples and assemblies men were
slain, and no account taken of them. There was no
more trusting either in friends or relations, for many
perished by those who were nearest to them. And no
inquiry was made into what had been done, but evil fell
without warning, and no one helped him that was down.
Law and contracts were no longer binding; every thing
went according to the will of the strongest, and the
state was like an unestablished tyranny, continually
passing into new hands and beginning afresh. The
minds of the authorities seemed to be amazed and enslaved
by fear of one man; and the judges determined
causes not according to law and justice, but as the parties
in the suit were in good or bad odour with the parties
in the state. For it was a capital offence that a judge
should controvert the orders of the ruling party, the
blues.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of Constantinople, the blues exulting
in the royal favour, when, in January, 532, the citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
were assembled in the hippodrome, the Emperor
himself presiding over the games. The green faction
disturbed the peace of the assembly by complaints, until
at length Justinian was induced to enter into a parley
with them by the voice of an officer called Mandator, a
sort of civil aide&ndash;de&ndash;camp, whose duty was to receive and
transmit his sovereign’s orders. The dialogue which
ensued is justly characterized by Gibbon, who has only
given a short specimen of it, as the most singular that
ever passed between a prince and his subjects.</p>

<p>We may premise, to account for the strange and unintelligible
turn of many of the sentences, that the
original is written in the corrupt Greek popularly
spoken at Constantinople in the sixth century, and is full
of allusions to which we possess no key, and words
which the lexicographers have not explained, and sentences
in which it is not possible to make out any grammatical
construction. These difficulties, however, make
the passage the more curious; inasmuch as they give
reason to suppose that the dialogue was taken down as it
occurred, and has not been polished in passing through
the hands of historians.</p>

<p class="p1">This seems to be a theological gibe at the unorthodox
party, which they repel with anger. There is an ambiguity
in the reply, which it is not easy to translate,
because, from the corruption of the text, or from the
debased Greek in which the dialogue is chiefly written,
we can come to no certain conclusion as to the real
meaning. They express their willingness to be baptized
according to order, and use a word which has been interpreted
either to mean “Bring water,” or to confer
on Justinian the appellation of “Pump.” There certainly
was something in it which raised the Emperor’s
wrath, and extracted from him a reply more to the purpose
than any yet made.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Abolish our colour—justice is at an end. Cease

at once! O that Sabbatius<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> had never been born, then
would he never have begotten such a murderer. This is the
twenty&ndash;sixth murder that is done at Zeugma. In the morning
he was at the theatre, in the evening he was slain,

<p><i>Blue.</i> You murdered him, and you accuse the blues.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Now the Lord pity us! Truth is oppressed. I
should like to enter into controversy with those who say that
God directs affairs. Whence this misery?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> God is not tempted by evil. And who then is it
that wrongs me? If there be here philosopher or hermit,
let him distinguish between the two.</p>

<p><i>Mand.</i> Blasphemers, odious to God, when will you cease?</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> If your greatness wishes it I keep quiet, though
against my will. Thrice august, I know all—all—but I
am silent. Justice, farewell, your time is up. I change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>

God knows.</p>

troubles me.</p>

<p><i>Green.</i> Dig up the bones of the spectators.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">After this the green party quitted the hippodrome,
and left there the Emperor and the blues. The sequel
may warn sovereigns against encouraging faction for
their own ends. At this moment seven notorious murderers
of both factions were paraded through the city
previous to their execution. Five were immediately put
to death, the other two obtained a respite by the breaking
of the rope which should have hanged them. One
of these surviving wretches belonged to the blue, the
other to the green faction; and the parties forgot their
enmity for a time to join in taking vengeance upon the
government, which durst do justice upon their members.
The consequence was a desperate tumult and insurrection,
which lasted five days, during which a great part of
the city was burnt; and which is known by the name of
Nika, Conquer, from the watchword adopted by the
rioters. For the history of it we must refer to Gibbon,
or to the original authorities quoted by him, especially
Procopius (Pers. i. 24) and Theophanes. At length
Justinian found means to revive the mutual animosity of
the factions; the blues resumed their allegiance to their
protector, and the greens, left alone in the hippodrome,
were attacked by the veteran troops of Belisarius, supported
by their inveterate opponents. More than 30,000
persons are said to have perished in the massacre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>A curious anecdote connected with this subject is
related elsewhere by Procopius. When Chosroes, the
King of Persia, invaded Syria, he went to Apamea to
see the sports of the circus; and having heard of Justinian’s
devotion to the blue faction, he thought it expedient
to patronize the green. The blue charioteer at first
had the advantage, the green following close upon his
track. Chosroes thinking this was done on purpose to
thwart him, became very angry, and cried out with
threats, that it was not fair to give Cæsar the start,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and
ordered the foremost to hold in their horses, and let the
green get before them. This was done, and Chosroes
and the greens plumed themselves on their victory.</p>

<p>The other example which we proposed to bring forward,
which probably has already suggested itself to
many of our readers, is one of the most memorable events
of the French Revolution, the massacre of September
2&ndash;6, 1792. A short preface may serve to introduce it,
since the history of the Revolution is pretty generally
familiar.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1792 the executive power of the
state was in effect wrested from the nominal authority,
the Legislative Assembly, by a body of men styled the
Commune, who had possessed themselves of the municipal
government of Paris. In this body the leading
persons were the flagitious triumvirate, Robespierre,
Danton, and Marat. It is needless to speculate on the
motives of such men. Whether the deed which we are
about to relate was perpetrated only to further the ends
of their party; whether, as some have said, it was
prompted by the desire to get rid of those who might
lay claim to a large mass of valuable personal property
which had been seized from persons who had been denounced
and arrested, and is said to have been embezzled
by those disinterested patriots; or whether it were
prompted solely by a savage thirst for blood:—which of
these, or what other motive was the moving cause of
this transaction, is of so little consequence towards determining
its character, that it would be a waste of words
to institute the inquiry. We proceed briefly to relate
the facts.</p>

<p>At the end of August, 1792, the invasion of the Prussians,
their advance to Verdun, and the capture of that
strong place, created a great panic in the capital. Apprehensions
were felt or expressed of a corresponding
movement within the country on the part of the royalists,
and the stern Danton asserted, in boding words,
that it was necessary to strike fear into those who were
disaffected to the republic. Before this time many
<i>aristocrats</i>, chiefly priests and nobles, had been confined
within the various prisons of Paris. Their numbers were
now increased to a fearful extent by recent arrests of
persons adverse to the Jacobin party, which then ruled
in the Commune, until all these receptacles of human
misery were filled to overflowing. The near approach
of the Prussians was doubly favourable to the views of
that party; it gave a colourable pretext for taking strong
measures against all who could be represented as favouring
the views of the invaders, and a reason for summoning
to the field the citizens who could be called on to
bear arms. The city being thus cleared of a large portion
of those who were most able, and probably most inclined
to interfere by force in the cause of justice and humanity,
a free and safe course was left open to the fury of that
turbulent party, whose yoke bore so heavy upon the
liberated nation. It was determined by the junta in
authority, that the safety of France required the massacre
of the prisoners; and in the Marseillois and the
mob of the capital, fit agents of the bloody mandate were
readily found.</p>

<p>The total number of persons confined in the Parisian
prisons is so differently stated that it is no easy matter
even to approximate to the truth; it is estimated by
Scott (vol. ii. p. 41) at about 8000. Early on the morning
of September 2, news arrived of the capture of Verdun
by the Prussians. This struck a terror into Paris,
by which the projectors of the massacre hastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
profit. The barriers were shut, the tocsin sounded, the
alarm&ndash;gun fired. The prisons of Les Carmes, the Abbaye,
and La Force, were first attacked, not in consequence
of any general popular impulse; not by multitudes,
such as had carried the Bastille and the Tuileries
against superior arms and discipline; but by a crew of
ruffians, composed partly of Marseillois, partly of the
savage mob of Paris, in number not perhaps much exceeding
a hundred, and goaded, it is said, with wine and
spirits mixed with stimulating and maddening drugs.
Armed with pikes, sabres, and similar weapons, they
beset the prison doors to the sound of the Marseillois
hymn, and demanded that the conspirators, as they called
them, should be delivered into their hands: and the
gaolers offered no resistance to their entrance.</p>

<p>Les Carmes, the Carmelite convent, had been converted
into a prison for suspected ecclesiastics. This was
the first object of attack; and, without parley, or the
pretence of trial or inquiry, the murderers burst in and
began to fire on their victims. “Where,” it was asked,
“is the Archbishop of Arles?” That prelate advanced
boldly, and was cut down without his uttering a word of
complaint. Others were hunted round the gardens, and
shot like wild beasts; some escaped over the walls. At
last, to proceed in a more orderly manner, and give less
opportunity for escape, the survivors were all collected
in the church, and led down two by two to be executed
in the garden. The Bishop of Saintes, whose leg had
been broken by a bullet, is reported to have said, “Gentlemen,
I am ready to go and die, like the rest; but you
see the state in which I am, my leg is broken; I beg
that you will assist me, and I will go willingly to execution.”
The difficulty of obtaining correct information
concerning these events may be estimated from the
statements of the number of ecclesiastics who perished in
Les Carmes. A royalist account raises it to 1168, a republican
account reduces it to 163.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> If it were necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to make choice of either, we should not hesitate to adopt
the smaller number.</p>

<p>The Abbaye and La Force were the next objects of
attack. Here there was some mockery of judicial observances.
The form of trial was brief enough; a few
armed ruffians constituted themselves a tribunal, before
which the prisoners were led one by one. The investigation
seldom went much beyond asking the name of the
person, and referring to the charges alleged against
him in the gaoler’s register. If these afforded ground
for the suspicion of incivism, and the judges, as was
almost always the case, decreed his death, their sentence,
to prevent the dangerous efforts of despair, was conveyed
in the equivocal terms, “Give the prisoner freedom,”
or, “Convey him to La Force,” if he were confined at
the Abbaye, and <i>vice versâ</i>. He was then led from the
room, and struck down, for the most part, before he
reached the court&ndash;yard, with eager cruelty. Women as
well as men mingled in this frightful scene, and inflicted
the most loathsome indignities on the mangled bodies.</p>

<p>These proceedings were virtually authorized and
encouraged by the presence of deputies from the
Commune, wearing the municipal scarf, but nominally
charged to select and deliver those who were imprisoned
for debt. Not content with this negative sanction,
Billaud Varennes, who was one of them, openly stimulated
the murderers, promising them not only the plunder
of the dead bodies, but the further gratification of a louis
per day, as the reward of their good service. And it
appears from the records of the time, that this money
was actually paid. Yet much of the trifling property
found on the persons of the slain was delivered up, it is
said, for the use of the state; as if the actors of these
horrors, by some strange caprice, had professed to be
really disinterested.</p>

<p>An officer named Saint Méard, who was confined in
the Abbaye, has written, under the title, ‘Mon Agonie
de trente&ndash;huit heures,’ an account of the feelings and
conduct of the prisoners during the frightful period of
suspense, which elapsed between the commencement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the massacres, and the moment when the fatal summons
reached each of the sufferers. “Our most important
occupation,” he says, “was to observe in what manner
death might be met most easily when we should enter
the place of slaughter. From time to time we sent one
of our number to a turret&ndash;window, to let us know how
the miserable men who were destroyed met their fate,
and to consider, from what they told us, how it would be
best for us to conduct ourselves. They said that those
who stretched out their hands protracted their sufferings,
because the sabre&ndash;strokes were deadened before they
reached the head: that sometimes their hands and arms
were even hewn off before they fell, and that those who
placed their hands behind their backs would suffer least.
It was on such horrid particulars as these that we had
to deliberate. We calculated the advantages of this
last&ndash;named position, and in turn advised each other to
assume it when our turn should arrive.” It is hard to
conceive a situation more trying to human fortitude.
The prisoners generally met their fate with firmness, and
in many instances boldly avowed and gloried in the
principles and hereditary honours which were the sure
passports to their fate. In some few instances the murderers
relented. One or two men were preserved by
the devoted interposition of female relatives. But very
few of those who were imprisoned on political grounds
lived to relate the horrors which they had passed through.
Saint Méard, although he boldly avowed himself a royalist,
was one of the number.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>For four days did this frightful scene continue, unsanctioned
by authority, save the instigation and half&ndash;expressed
approbation of the Commune, perpetrated by
an insignificant mob, who, with the smallest portion of
energy, might have been overpowered at once. The
Legislative Assembly sent some of their members to
remonstrate; men known as Jacobins, who came back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and related that their interference had been ineffectual,
and no further steps were taken. The National Guard
remained quiet, waiting the orders of their superiors.
Meanwhile, amid this fear or lethargy, for neither the
Assembly nor the Guard viewed this butchery with
favourable eyes, the judges and executioners ate, drank,
and slept, and returned unmolested and with new vigour
to their several functions.</p>

<p>The thirst of blood, once indulged, appears to have
given rise to a sort of intoxication. The mob attacked
even the Bicêtre, a prison containing none but criminals
and lunatics. Here only they experienced resistance;
and the resistance was desperate. The gaolers made
common cause with the prisoners against the assailants;
the stones and iron bars of the building supplying them
with weapons. They made good their defence until
cannon were brought against them, and they were mowed
down in the mass.</p>

<p>Of the number of persons who perished in this fearful
scene no exact account has ever been given. It is said,
however, that not more than 200 or 300 of the prisoners
committed for political offences are known to have
escaped; and on the smallest reckoning the slain
amounted to 2000 or 3000. Some estimate them at double
that number. Truchat stated to the Legislative Assembly
that 4000 had fallen. One statement, which is introduced
only to show the tendency to exaggeration in
these matters, raised the number to 12,800. Those who
were imprisoned for debt were set free by order of the
Commune; and to these we must look to make up the
difference between the number of the slain and the total
number of 8000, said to have been in prison on September
2. The bodies were interred in trenches, prepared,
it is said, beforehand by the Commune, but their
bones were subsequently transferred to the Catacombs.
“In these melancholy regions, while other relics of
mortality lie exposed all around, the remains of those
who perished in the massacres of September are alone
excluded from the public eye. The vault in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
repose is closed with a screen of freestone, as if relating
to crimes unfit to be thought of even in the proper abode
of death, and which France would willingly hide in
oblivion.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">Character of Cleon—Blockade and Capture of the Lacedæmonians

Bello by Admiral Vernon—Greek comedy—Sketch of the
Knights of Aristophanes—Subsequent history of Cleon—Account

<p class="pn">Within very few years after the beginning of the Peloponnesian
war, a striking change took place both in the
measures and the ministers of the state. Miltiades,
Aristides, Themistocles, Cimon, Pericles, were all pre&ndash;eminent
in personal merit, and most of them possessed of
hereditary distinction also. Nicias, a man of rank and
virtue, succeeded in appearance to the high station of
Pericles, but not to his talents and influence over his
turbulent countrymen, who, after having been long
governed by the most illustrious of Grecian statesmen,
threw themselves into the arms of the worst of Grecian
demagogues. After Pericles’ death, popular favour
veered for a short time between Eucrates, a flax&ndash;seller,
and Lysicles, a sheep&ndash;seller; until a man, low equally in
origin, habits, and education, carried away the prize,
and employed it, as the folly of his supporters deserved,
to the ruin of the state. “The son of a tanner, and
himself bred to the trade; without those generous feelings
which seem inherent in high birth, and without
that regard for character which it is the purpose of
education to inspire, Cleon possessed those corporeal
powers, which, in the eyes of a mob, often supply the
place of both:—with a bulky body, a voice potent even
beyond the extreme extent of value attached to such a
qualification among the Greeks, with a most republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
indifference to all exterior decorations of person, and a
face bearing on it the marks of vulgar intemperance,
Nature herself seems to have formed Cleon for a demagogue.
His interior qualifications were just what his
exterior promised; he being, as Mr. Mitford observes,
‘of extraordinary impudence and little courage; as slack
in the field as he was forward and noisy in the assembly,
and as base in practice as he was corrupt in principle.’
That such a man should ever have stood in the situation
of head of a party seems to us almost incredible: but he
possessed one redeeming qualification in an eminent degree;
and among a nation which pardoned everything to
the pleasure of indulging its ears, the coarse but ready
eloquence of Cleon, exerted in those ways which were
most calculated to please an Athenian audience—in
boasts of his own integrity, and accusations of all the
respectable men of rank—this formed a splendid addition
to his character, which threw into the shade all his other
defects.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> By this man’s persuasion that atrocious decree
was passed, which condemned to death every male
of the Mityleneans, and reduced to slavery their wives
and children: a fate but just averted by the repentance
of the Athenians, whose vengeance nevertheless was
gratified by the execution of a thousand prisoners.
Through his folly and presumption, the opportunity was
lost of concluding an honourable and advantageous peace,
when good fortune and the military talent of Demosthenes
had thrown the Spartan army at Sphacteria into
their power. This event, which raised Cleon’s popularity
to its greatest height, has also made known his
character to all ages. His name would have been comparatively
little bruited abroad by the grave censure of
Thucydides; but the satire of Aristophanes has conferred
on it a most undesirable celebrity.</p>

<p>Sphacteria, now called Sphagia,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> is a small island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
situated in the centre of the mouth of the bay of Pylos,
well known in modern history by the name of Navarino,
which it nearly closes, leaving a narrow passage on either
side. In the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 425, in the seventh year of the
war, the Athenian fleet, under the command of Eurymedon
and Demosthenes, raised a small fort at Pylos,
intending to garrison it with Messenians, the obstinate
and hereditary enemies of Lacedæmon.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The fleet then
sailed away, leaving only five ships and their crews,
under the command of Demosthenes. The Spartan government
immediately sent a force to attack him by land
and sea; and to make the blockade effectual, they placed
a body of Lacedæmonians in the island, meaning to close
both the inlets of the harbour with their ships. But the
Athenian fleet returned in time to save their little garrison;
and a naval victory made them masters of the sea,
and of the destiny of the 420 Lacedæmonians thus shut
up on the uninhabited and uncultivated island of Sphacteria.</p>

<p>Consternation ran high in Sparta on receiving this
news, for many persons of the first families were among
the detachment thus entrapped; and an embassy was sent
to Athens to negotiate for peace. A truce was concluded
in the first instance, by which the Spartans were still
detained on the island, but were to be supplied with a
regulated allowance of food; and advantageous and
honourable terms were offered, on which a lasting pacification
might be founded. But Cleon induced the
Athenians to require more than the Spartans would, or
perhaps could, consent to or fulfil. In consequence, hostilities
were renewed, and the capture of the Spartans
became an object of primary importance. The island
was rocky and woody, and it was thought inexpedient to
reduce them by force; a strict blockade was therefore
drawn round the island to starve them into submission.
But during the truce they probably had husbanded the provision
allowed them; and a scanty supply was introduced
by expert swimmers, who dragged after them skins filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with poppy&ndash;seed mixed with honey, or bruised linseed, or
by boats, which ran for the island on the seaward side in
stormy nights, when it was difficult to maintain the blockade:
and the Athenians began to be alarmed lest, in the
difficulty and uncertainty of a winter blockade, they
might lose their prey. The sequel may be best related
from Thucydides, and in the following graphic passage
of Plutarch, which supplies some curious notices of
Cleon:—</p>

<p>“When the people saw that this siege drew out in
length, and that their camp suffered grievous wants and
necessities, then they fell out with Cleon, and he again
burdened Nicias, saying, that through his fear he would
let the besieged Spartans escape, and that if he had been
captain they should not have held out so long. Thereupon
the Athenians said aloud to Cleon, ‘And why dost
not thou go thither then to take them?’ Moreover
Nicias selfe also rising up, openly gave him his authority
to take this Pylos, and bade him levy as many soldiers as he
would to go thither, and not to bragg with such impudent
words, where there was no danger, but to do some notable
service to the commonwealth. Cleon at the first shrunk
back, being amazed withal, little thinking they would
have taken him so suddenly at his word: but in the end,
perceiving the people urged him to it, and that Nicias
also was importunate with him, ambition so inflamed him,
that he not only took the charge upon him, but in a
bravery said, that within twenty days after his departure
he would either put all the Spartans to the sword, or
bring them prisoners to Athens. The Athenians hearing
Cleon say so, had more lust to laugh than to believe
that he spake; for it was their manner ever to laugh at
his anger and folly. For it is reported of him, that the
people on a time being solemnly assembled in council
early in the morning, to hear what Cleon would say, and
having tarried long for him, at the length he came with
a garland on his head, and prayed the assembly to dismiss
the court till the next morning: for (quoth he) I
shall not be at leisure to&ndash;day, because I have sacrificed,
and do feast also certain strangers, my friends, that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
come to see me. So the people burst out in a laughing,
and brake up the assembly.... But herein Nicias did
great harm to the commonwealth, suffering Cleon in that
sort to grow to credit and estimation. For after that
victory Cleon grew to so haughty a mind and pride of
himself, that he was not to be dealt withal; whereupon
fell out the occasion of the great miseries that happened
to the city of Athens, by which Nicias himself was not
the smallest sufferer. For Cleon, among other things,
took away the modesty and reverence used before in public
orations to the people: he of all men was the first that
cried out in his orations, that clapped his hand on his
thigh, threw open his gowne, and flung up and down the
pulpit as he spoke. Of which example afterwards followed
all licentiousness and contempt of honesty, the
which all the orators and counsellors fell into that dealt
in matters of state and commonwealth, and was in the end
the overthrow of all together.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>“Nicias seeing the Athenians to be in a kind of tumult
against Cleon, for that when he thought it so easy
a matter, he did not presently put it in practice, and
seeing also he had upbraided him, willed him to take
what strength he would, that they could give him, and
undertake it. Cleon, supposing at first that he gave him
this leave but in words, was ready to accept it; but
when he knew he would give him the authority in good
earnest, then he shrunk back, and said, that not he, but
Nicias, was general: being now indeed afraid, and
hoping that he durst not have given over the office to
him. But then Nicias again bade him do it, and gave
over his command to him, for so much as concerned
Pylos, and called the Athenians to witness it. They
(as is the fashion of the multitude), the more Cleon
declined the voyage, and went back from his word,
pressed Nicias so much the more to resign his power to
him, and cried out upon Cleon to go. Insomuch, as not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
knowing how to disengage himself of his word, he undertook
the voyage, and stood forth, saying, that he feared
not the Lacedæmonians, and that he would not carry
any man with him out of the city, but only the Lemnians
and Imbrians that were then present, and those
targeteers that were come to them from &OElig;nus, and 400
archers out of other places, and with these, he said,
added to the soldiers that were at Pylos already, he
would, within twenty days, either fetch away the Lacedæmonians
alive, or kill them upon the place.</p>

<p>“This vain speech moved amongst the Athenians
some laughter, and was heard with great content of the
wiser sort. For of two benefits, the one must needs fall
out; either to be rid of Cleon (which was their greatest
hope), or if they were deceived in that, then to get
those Lacedæmonians into their hands.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Cleon sailed accordingly; but in the interim a fire had
consumed the woods on the island, and Demosthenes, an
able and successful general, was already preparing to attack
the Lacedæmonians. Cleon was prudent enough
to leave the direction of the assault in his hands. After
an obstinate resistance, the Lacedæmonian force at last
surrendered, being reduced in number to 292, of whom
120 were Spartans; and within the time prescribed
Cleon returned in triumph to Athens with his prisoners.
Thucydides says, that no event throughout the war
created so much astonishment in Greece as this; it being
the general opinion that the Lacedæmonians would not
yield up their arms for famine, or for any other extremity,
but rather die with them, fighting as they best could.</p>

<p>Since this chapter was written, we have seen, in a
work the scanty sale of which says little for the general
diffusion of a taste for sound scholarship in England, an
ingenious parallel between the remarkable transaction
above narrated, and a passage in English history. The
work in question, the ‘Philological Museum,’ is likely
not to be in the hands of a large proportion of our
readers; and instead of merely referring to it, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
proceed to transcribe a portion of the article in question.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mitford, in his elaborate narrative of the Peloponnesian
war, has drawn a comparison between the
military operations of Brasidas in the Athenian dependencies
lying towards Thrace, and those of General
Wolfe, the hero of Quebec, in Canada. The points of
resemblance are very remarkable; but, as he observes,
the differences are also obvious. The parallel is, however,
sufficiently close to awaken that interest which all
men naturally feel in marking the identity of the human
character, under similar circumstances, in ages and
countries far removed from each other. Such indications
of a common nature connect one generation with another,
and bring home to the mind a more lively conception of
the past. The parallel about to be drawn fetches one of
its subjects from the same period of Grecian history, so
fertile in remarkable men and striking incidents. If, in
Mr. Mitford’s case, the points of difference be thought to
outweigh those of resemblance, it may perhaps be said,
that in the following comparison the preponderance is
exactly reversed. It is needless to give a second account
of what we have fully described, the transactions at
Sphacteria, and the singular arrangement between Cleon
and Nicias.” After a short notice of these events, the
author continues: “The people applaud Cleon’s bold
proposal, and insist on his going to redeem his word,
whether he would or not. He goes, and is completely
successful, bringing the captives to Athens within the
specified twenty days. The applause of the citizens exceeded
all moderation, with which party spirit had perhaps
something to do. Cleon was esteemed a first&ndash;rate
general, and accordingly sent out to match the incomparable
Brasidas.</p>

<p>“The temper of the English public, at the period to
which we are about to refer, is well evinced by the uncommon
popularity of Glover’s ballad, entitled Admiral
Hosier’s Ghost, which was a political squib. Hosier had
been sent out to protect the West Indian trade against
the Spaniards, who were a terror to our merchantmen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
those seas. Their principal station was Porto Bello; off
which accordingly Hosier cruised. But he had instructions
not to make aggressions on the enemy; and he remained
inactive at sea, insulted and despised by the
Spaniards, till his crews became diseased, and he at last died
of a broken heart. He was a brave sailor, but his orders
kept him inactive. This state of things, so disgraceful
to our naval power, continued till 1739; when Admiral
Vernon, who was a fierce and not ineloquent assailant in
debate, and the delight of his party in the House of
Commons from his blunt impudence and harassing hostility
to Ministers, came prominently before the public.
He was esteemed a pretty good officer; but his boisterous
manner in the house was his principal recommendation.
In a debate on the Spanish depredations, which still continued
unrepressed, he chanced to affirm that Porto
Bello might be easily taken, if the officers did their
duty; and led on by the ardour of debate, he even
pledged himself to capture the place, with only six ships
of war, if they would put him in command. The opposition
re&ndash;echoed his proposal. Vernon was called by anticipation
a Drake and a Raleigh; and his popularity
no bounds. The minister, Sir R. Walpole, glad to appease
the popular clamour, and to get rid for a time of
Vernon’s busy opposition in the Commons; and hoping
perhaps, like Nicias, that by the failure of his boast he
would disgrace himself and his party, or else clear the
seas of the Spaniards; closed with the offer so lightly
made, and actually sent him out with a fleet to the
West Indies. Vernon sailed, and was as good as his
word. He speedily took Porto Bello, and demolished all
the fortifications. Both houses joined in an address;
Vernon rose to the highest pitch of popularity; and the
‘nation in general (observes the historian) was wonderfully
elated by an exploit, which was magnified much
above its merit.’ A Sacheverel or a Vernon are quite
sufficient pillars for a party to rear a triumphal arch
upon.</p>

<p>“The extraordinary performance of an extravagant
boast, under circumstances unexpectedly favourable, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
not more observable in both cases, than the speedy exposure
of the inability of both commanders, when subsequently
put to the test. The hero of Sphacteria at the
head of a brave army in Thrace, with which he did not
know what to do<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> next, like a chess&ndash;player who does not
see his next move, is absolutely ludicrous. The conduct
of the conqueror of Porto Bello, when intrusted
with a powerful fleet on a larger field of action, is
equally decisive of his real merits. He failed most
miserably as admiral on the West India station; thus
showing that a <i>coup de main</i>, whether in politics or war,
though it often succeed most signally, is no safe evidence
of general ability.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Fortified as to our facts by the authority of history,
we may proceed, after this digression, to develop the
chief object of this chapter, which is to give a sketch of
one of the most remarkable productions of Greek literature,
the ‘Knights’ of Aristophanes, and to exhibit the
Aristophanic Cleon, who, even after this preface, will
surprise those who are unacquainted with him. We shall
not be at a loss to find a parallel for him in our own
history. To Cleon and his politics Aristophanes was
violently opposed. Much undeserved obloquy has been
thrown in times past upon this poet: it is now pretty
generally acknowledged that the heaviest charges against
him are undeserved: that he saw clearly what were the
true interests of his country, and feared not to tell his
turbulent countrymen their faults to their face. The
medicine indeed required to be disguised to render it palatable,
and we must regret that the vehicle employed
was such as to render it disgusting to modern delicacy:
but the fault of this lay partly in the state of society in
which the poet lived; the courage, the clear&ndash;sightedness,
and the brilliant talent are his own peculiar glory.</p>

<p>The Grecian comedy is a delicate and difficult subject
to touch upon: for to those who are unacquainted with
the original, abstracts and translations present little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
than the lifeless form in its somewhat startling extravagance.
Of the wit, the greatest part must evaporate,
and the remainder requires, in order to be relished, some
familiarity with the manners to which it refers. The
Grecian drama had its origin in religion. In the worship
of Dionysius, or Bacchus, one of the earliest of the Grecian
deities, it was usual to introduce two sorts of poetry; the
one lofty and panegyrical, the other ludicrous and satirical.
As these rude attempts acquired extent and
polish, they separated in character more and more
widely: until the former acquired the exalted and highly
reverential cast which we see in the tragedies of Æschylus;
while the latter retained its original features, more
pleasing to a deity who is mythologically represented as
inspiring and partaking the most fantastic rites of his followers,
and as being offended by nothing except sobriety
or gravity. Extravagance and indecency therefore became
a religious duty, and one that the Athenians fulfilled
with pious fervour. The drama was a matter of
public interest; plays were performed, not daily, but
upon the festivals of Bacchus, in the early spring,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> in
theatres of vast extent, with all the magnificence and
effect which anxious care and unsparing expense could
produce; judges were appointed by the public to decide
upon the merits of the pieces represented, and the prize
of victory was sought with an eagerness totally disproportioned,
according to modern notions, to the object in
view.</p>

<p>In co&ndash;operation with the author, certain persons, called
Choragi, were appointed by law, at whose expense the
Chorus was provided, and carefully instructed in the
parts which they were to perform. Upon the taste and
liberality of the Choragus the success of the author
mainly depended; and if successful, he consecrated to
Bacchus a tripod inscribed with his own name, that of
the author, and of the magistrate who gave his name to
the year. The modern drama possesses nothing which
resembles the Chorus. We have already noticed the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
songs from which theatrical entertainments were
derived. The first step to their improvement was the
introduction of some mythological narration by another
person to relieve the singer; the second, the conversion
of this narrative into dialogue, by the introduction of a
second actor. For some time the original Bacchic
song maintained its ground in the intervals of recitation;
but at length the lyrical part was made to bear upon the
rest of the performance, and as a taste for splendour was
developed, the number of singers was increased from one
to three, fifteen, or even a greater number.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In the
advanced state of the art the Chorus bore marks of its
original constitution, being still regarded as a single
actor, and mingling in the dialogue by means of its
Coryphæus, or leader. In tragedy it was composed of
old men, maidens, or any class of persons who were interested
in the catastrophe of the piece: the comic poets
took a wider range, and availed themselves of the boldest
personifications which they thought likely to produce
effect. Thus in one play of Aristophanes there is a
Chorus of Clouds, in another of Birds, in another of
Frogs, in another of Wasps, which were all so habited
as to bear some vague resemblance to the things they
personated, in a manner which such as recollect a pantomime
of no very old date, called Harlequin and the
Queen Bee, will be at no loss to comprehend. The introductory
scenes of our pantomimes often seem to imitate
these freaks of Grecian comedy; as for instance, in
Harlequin Gulliver, where the inhabitants of the dogstar,
as described by another eminent traveller, Baron
Munchausen, came in to sing; also a chorus of men with
their heads under their shoulders. And indeed the latter
scenes of pantomime, by retrenching the practical
jokes, and by the introduction of dialogue, might be
made to bear considerable resemblance to Grecian
comedy. Grimaldi’s parody of the dagger&ndash;scene in
Macbeth, although principally aimed at a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
actor, was a capital parallel to the pitiless pelting of wit
carried on by the comedians of Athens against the tragedians,
and against each other.</p>

<p>No history of the gradual formation of comedy has
come down to us, but in the time of Aristophanes we
find her possessed of most extraordinary privileges, and
availing herself of them to the extremity of licence.
To laugh was the grand object of the audience, and
any thing was tolerated which led to this conclusion.
The slang of the port and the market, the pleadings
of the law courts, the peculiar language of handicrafts,
were all carefully studied and profusely introduced, in
combination with the grossest buffoonery and indecency,
and the most unsparing personal abuse. In a
town like Athens, the population of which, though
large, was crowded within a narrow space and almost
living in the open air, a joke directed against the peculiarities,
corporeal or moral, of any person of any sort of
notoriety, was pretty sure to be understood, and if understood,
quite sure to be relished. Masks were
always worn by the actors, and if a living character was
brought on the stage the mask was a portrait. Unlucky
poets, public defaulters, peculators, and notorious profligates,
formed the stock in trade common to all comedians;
and a more exceptionable source of amusement
was found in the unrestrained indulgence of private
malevolence. Even the sacred persons of the gods were
fair game; and Bacchus, the patron of the festival, was
made to minister to the amusement of his riotous worshippers
as the earliest Captain Bohadil upon record.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Such are the features of the elder Grecian comedy, confirmed
by, and indeed mainly derived from the works of
Aristophanes, the only comedian of whom a perfect specimen
remains.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>After this exposition the reader may be surprised at
the respectful terms in which we have above spoken of
him. But it is pretty certain that he saw clearly the true
interests of his country; and there is good ground for
thinking that four at least of the eleven plays now extant
were written with the express view of improving its
policy, or, strange as it may appear, of correcting its
morals; while through them all the national faults of the
Athenians are lashed with an unsparing and somewhat
dangerous severity. To argue this question would transport
us far from our subject, from which indeed we have
already wandered wide, and far beyond our limits: and is
the less necessary because it has already been fully argued
in works of easy access (Mitchell, Prelim. Discourse;
Schlegel, Lectures on History of Literature, Observer).
On the literary merits of Aristophanes all are agreed.
For power and variety of versification, he stands unrivalled;
for command of the noble language in which
he wrote, he is perhaps unmatched, except by Plato.
His wit it would be superfluous to praise; unfortunately
it is too often exercised on subjects which endure not an
English dress. Nothing perhaps approaches so nearly
to the usual style of his dialogue as the less refined parts
of Shakspere’s comedies, but the latter want that political
design which, pervading the Grecian, inclines us to
forget the means in the end, and are in other respects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
scarcely equal to the comparison. But amidst all this
ribaldry he often breaks out in a vein of pure and
exalted poetry, sufficient to show that he was capable of
excelling in the most elegant or dignified departments of
the art, had the temper of his countrymen been such as
to profit by or allow a hearing to serious admonition.</p>

<p>One of his most celebrated comedies, ‘The Knights,’
is directed expressly to destroy the popularity of Cleon.
The danger incurred by the author is evident from an
anecdote related by himself, that no maskmaker could be
induced to furnish a likeness of the demagogue.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> And as
no actor would perform the part, the poet himself made
his first appearance on the stage in it, his face rubbed
with vermilion, or the lees of wine, to imitate Cleon’s
complexion, and serve in some degree for a disguise.
The plot, if we may call it such, is mainly founded on the
transactions at Pylos, already related, and the characters
are selected accordingly.</p>

<p>Nicias, Demosthenes, and Cleon figure as slaves of
Demus, literally “the people,” who represents the
Athenian as John Bull does the English nation. The
only other character is an itinerant sausage&ndash;seller. The
chorus is composed of knights or horsemen, the richer
class of citizens, who were obliged to keep a horse and
be prepared for the cavalry service. Demosthenes and
Nicias appear in the first scene, and complain bitterly of
a certain Paphlagonian; such is the country which the
poet has assigned to Cleon, whom their master has
lately brought home, partly, according to the Scholiast
(Knights, verse 2), for the sake of an untranslateable
pun, partly because the Paphlagonians had the reputation
of making the worst&ndash;conditioned slaves of all
who came to the Athenian market. After some quibbling
they agree to submit their case to the spectators,
and Demosthenes states it as follows:<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>—</p>

I could perhaps—“ We take the gentle hint,<br />
And give him all; if not, the old man’s foot<br />
Plays such a tune upon our hinder parts—<br />

To take, or where to look for help.</p>

<p class="pr4"><i>Mitchell</i>, p. 161&ndash;4.</p>

<p class="p1">The remedy however baffles their ingenuity, till
Demosthenes, through the inspiration of the wine&ndash;flask,
sends his comrade to steal from Cleon, who is asleep
within, a certain book of oracles which he hoards with
especial care. They are happily secured and handed
over to Demosthenes, whose activity is all along contrasted
with the indecision of Nicias. After repeated
application for more wine to clear his understanding, he
at last condescends to enlighten his companion’s impatience.</p>

<p class="pr4"><i>Mitchell</i>, p. 170&ndash;2.</p>

<p class="p1">A person exercising this lofty vocation is now seen approaching
and is eagerly hailed, as sent at this moment
by the especial favour of the gods. Their fated deliverer,
however, is a modest man, and cannot easily be
led to believe the high destiny that awaits him. I am a
sausage&ndash;seller, he says; how should I become a man?
Demosthenes assures him that the qualities belonging to
his profession—impudence and cheating—are precisely
those to which his greatness is to be owing: but still
failing to overcome his scruples, he is led to suspect the
sausage&ndash;seller of the unpardonable fault of having some
taint of gentility in his extraction. Satisfied on this
point, he proceeds to expound the oracles. The incipient
statesman yields to their predictions, and readily
receives instructions for his public life. “The oracles
indeed do flatter me; but I wonder how I shall be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

to his professional experience.</p>

<p class="p1">Cleon now comes on the stage, with the usual cry,
“The commonwealth is in danger,” and is immediately
followed by the Chorus, who attack him in an indignant
burst, which defies translation. A long scene of abuse and
recrimination follows for near three hundred lines, in the
course of which every art and trade is made to contribute
to the contest of abuse, till Cleon at length accuses his
rival of having received ten talents as a bribe. “What
then,” he replies, “will you take one of them to hold
your tongue?” “That he will, and gladly,” replies the
Chorus: “see, the wind is going down already.” The
satire was the keener, because Cleon had recently been
fined five talents on a conviction for bribery.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> At length,
being somewhat worsted, he leaves the stage, with the
threat of denouncing to the council “the nightly meetings
in the city, and conspiracies with the Medes and
B&oelig;otians,” in which his tormentors are engaged. The
sausage&ndash;seller follows to countermine him, and the stage
is left clear for the Parabasis, or customary address of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the Chorus to the audience. This was generally unconnected
with the play, and served as an opportunity for
the author to deliver his sentiments upon all things and
all people. It was chiefly satirical, but in Aristophanes
is usually intermixed with passages of a highly poetical
cast, which strike the more from being introduced by a

<p class="ppi4 p1">
<i>Saus.</i> Straight as he went from hence, I clapt all sail<br />
And followed close behind. Within I found him<br />
Launching his bolts, and thunder&ndash;driving words,<br />
Denouncing all the knights as traitors, vile<br />
Conspirators—jags, crags, and masses huge<br />
Of stone were nothing to the monstrous words<br />
His foaming mouth heaved up. All this to hear<br />
Did the grave council seriously incline;<br />
They love a tale of scandal in their hearts,<br />
And his had been as quick in birth as golden&ndash;herb:<br />
Mustard was in their faces, and their brows<br />
With frowns were furrowed up. I saw the storm,<br />
Marked how his words had sunk upon them, taking<br />
Their very senses prisoners:—and oh!<br />
In knavery’s name thought I,—by all the fools,<br />
And scrubs, and rogues, and scoundrels in the town—<br />
By that same market, where my early youth<br />
Received its first instruction, let me gather<br />
True courage now: be oil upon my tongue,<br />
And shameless impudence direct my speech.<br />
Just as these thoughts passed over me, I heard<br />
A sound of thunder pealing on my right.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a><br />
I marked the omen—grateful, kissed the ground,<br />
And pushing briskly through the lattice&ndash;work,<br />
Raised my voice to its highest pitch, and thus<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>Began upon them: “Messieurs of the Senate,<br />
I bring good news, and hope your favour for it.<br />
Anchovies, such as since this war began,<br />
Ne’er crossed my eyes for cheapness, do this day<br />
Adorn our markets.”—At the words, a calm<br />
Came over every face, and all was hushed.<br />
A crown<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> was voted me upon the spot.<br />
Then I (the thought was of the moment’s birth)<br />
Making a mighty secret of it, bade them<br />
Put pans and pots in instant requisition,<br />
And then—one obol loads you with anchovies.<br />
Then rose the clap of hands, and every face<br />
Gaped into mine, in idiot vacancy.<br />
My Paphlagonian, seeing by what words<br />
The council best were pleased, thus uttered him:<br />
“Sirs, Gentlemen, ‘tis my good will and pleasure<br />
That for this kindly news, we sacrifice<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a><br />
One hundred oxen to our patron goddess.”<br />
Straight the tide turned, each head within the senate<br />
Nodded assent, and warm good will to Cleon.<br />
What! shall a little bull&ndash;flesh gain the day,<br />
Thought I within me: then aloud, and shooting<br />
Beyond his mark: I double, sirs, this vote;<br />
Nay, more, sirs, should to&ndash;morrow’s sun see sprats<br />
One hundred to the penny sold, I move<br />
That we make offering of a thousand goats<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a><br />
Unto Diana. Every head was raised,<br />
And all turned eyes on me. This was a blow<br />
He ne’er recovered: straight he fell to words<br />
Of idle import, and the officers<br />
Were now upon him. All meantime was uproar<br />
In th’ assembly—nought talked of but anchovies—<br />
How fared our statesman? he with suppliant tones<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Begged a few moments’ pause; Rest ye, sirs, rest ye<br />
Awhile—I have a tale will pay the hearing—<br />
A herald brings from Sparta terms of peace,<br />
And craves to utter them before you. “Peace!”<br />
Cried all (their voices one), “is this a time<br />
To talk of peace?—out, dotard! What, the rogues<br />
Have heard the price anchovies sell for! Peace!<br />
Who cares for peace now? let the war go on;<br />
And, chairman, break the assembly up.” ‘Twas done—<br />
On every side, one moment clears the rails!<br />
I the mean time steal privately away<br />
And buy me all the leeks and coriander<br />
In the market: these I straight make largess of,<br />
And gratis give, as sauce to dress their fish.<br />
Who may recount the praises infinite,<br />
And groom&ndash;like courtesies this bounty gained me!<br />
In short, you see a man, that for one pennyworth<br />
Of coriander vile, has purchased him<br />
An entire senate: not a man among them<br />
But is at my behest, and does me reverence.</p>

<p class="pr4"><i>Mitchell</i>, p. 217, 221.</p>

<p class="p1">So soon as the Chorus has expressed its high satisfaction,
Cleon enters, and the war of words is renewed
with equal spirit, till he calls upon Demus to appear,
and see what ill treatment he suffers on his account.
Demus hears the candidates for his favour, and resolves
to call an assembly to decide on their claims; but he insists
that it shall be held in his proper seat, the Pnyx, to
the dismay of the sausage&ndash;seller, who exclaims that he is
ruined; since Demus, though a clever fellow anywhere
else, is a gaping ninny when he gets on one of those
stone benches.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> However, there is no help for it; the
scene changes to the Pnyx, and the sausage&ndash;seller makes
a favourable impression by presenting to Demus a cushion
to keep him from the bare stone, with a most pathetic
reference to his exploits at Salamis;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> a subject in reference
to which the Athenians would swallow any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
amount of flattery. Having gained the ear of the court,
he exposes the mischievous tendency of Cleon’s warlike
politics, all the gain of which was his own, while the
evil and inconvenience were the portion of Demus.
This produces an effect which all the protestations of
Cleon cannot remove. “You that profess such devotion,”
continues his enemy, “did you ever, out of all
the hides you sell, give him so much as a pair of shoes?”
“Not he, indeed,” replies Demus. A pair is immediately
presented, and the provident donor receives the
grateful assurance, that of all men living he is the best
friend to the people, the city, “and to my toes.” This
specimen will probably be sufficient: the result is altogether
favourable to the sausage&ndash;seller, who is put in
possession of Cleon’s signet of office. The latter still
has a resource: he appeals to his favourite oracles; but
even here he meets with his match. They both quit
the stage, and return laden.</p>

<p class="p1">Here ends the contest of oracles; and Demus, after
expresssing his opinion that there never was a wiser
man than Glanis, commits himself to the guidance and
instruction of the sausage&ndash;seller. He is induced to
pause, however, by the offers which Cleon makes, of
supplying his table with provisions, and finally comes to
the resolution of “giving the reins of the Pnyx” to
which soever of the two candidates shall offer the most
acceptable bribes. They quit the stage, each endeavouring
to get the advantage in a false start; and the Chorus
comes forward with an address to Demus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"> They return laden with all sorts of eatables. “The
sausage&ndash;seller has the advantage of his rival for some
time in his presents, till Cleon awakens his fears by
talking of a dish of hare, which he has exclusively to
present. His rival, disconcerted at first, has recourse to
a stratagem. ‘Some ambassadors come this way, <i>and
their purses seem well filled</i>.’ ‘Where are they?’ exclaims
Cleon eagerly, and turns about. The hare&ndash;flesh
was immediately in the hands of his rival, who presents
the boasted dainty in his own name to Demus, and casts
the old affair of Pylos in the disappointed Cleon’s
teeth.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>“While the sausage&ndash;seller piously refers the suggestion
of this little theft to Minerva, and modestly takes
the execution only to himself, Cleon resents the surprise
very warmly. ‘I had all the danger of catching the
hare,’ says he. ‘I had all the trouble of dressing it,’
says his rival. ‘Fools,’ says Demus, ‘I care not who
caught it, nor who dressed it; all I regard is the hand
which serves it up to table.’ The sausage&ndash;seller proposes
a new test of affection. ‘Let our chests be
searched; it will then be proved who is the better man
towards Demus and his stomach.’ This is accordingly
done. That of the new candidate for power is found
empty. ‘He had given his dear little grandfather
every thing;’ and the person so benefited signifies his
approbation. ‘This chest is well disposed towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Demus.’ In Cleon’s is found abundance of all good
things; and a tempting cheese&ndash;cake particularly excites
Demus’s surprise. ‘The rogue,’ says this representative
of the sovereign multitude, ‘to conceal such a prodigious
cheese&ndash;cake as this, and to cut me off with a
mere morsel of it.’ Cleon in vain pleads, that he stole
it for the good of his country. He is ordered to lay
down his chaplet,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and invest his antagonist with it.
Nay, says he, still struggling for the retention of office.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Chorus now enters upon an address, first in
praise of the equestrian order, and then proceeding to
satirize individuals by name. Meanwhile Demus is
undergoing a thorough purgation under the hands of the
sausage&ndash;seller. He reappears “in his former splendour
of the days of Miltiades and Aristides,” delivers a recantation
of his former principles, and concludes the
piece by confirming the appointment of the sausage&ndash;seller
to Cleon’s place, and investing Cleon solemnly
with the tray, and other implements of the sausage&ndash;seller.</p>

<p>To those who are disappointed in the specimen here
given of the wit and humour of Aristophanes, we have
only to suggest in defence of our author, that a large
proportion of the most remarkable passages have been
omitted, on account of the impossibility of rendering
them intelligible, even by a prolix commentary, to those
who cannot read the original; and that our description
of the ‘Knights’ is but a set of fragments from a
translation, which professes its inability to render its
original as a whole. And we may quote, as much more
applicable to this short attempt than to the work to
which it is prefixed, the singularly happy and modest
motto of Mr. Mitchell’s translation, applicable as it
must be to all translations, but especially to those of
Aristophanes.</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">Among the rest, he culled me out a root;<br />
The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it;<br />
And in another country, as he said,<br />
Bore a bright golden flower, <i>but not in this soil</i>.</p>

<p class="pr4"><i>Comus.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In the Parabasis to the Clouds, performed two years
after the Knights, the poet refers with pride to his
attack on Cleon at his highest; but though he returns
to the charge once and again, he makes no mention of
any fine imposed upon him; which is in itself almost a
sufficient refutation of the story mentioned in a previous
note. The play was so relished as to gain the first prize,
but there is not a jot of evidence to show that Cleon’s
popularity was overclouded by it. Happily his reign
only lasted for two years after it. His success at Pylus
flattered him into a belief in his talents for war, and he
took the command of the army in Thrace, opposed to
Brasidas, the best Spartan general of his day. His incapacity
lost the Athenians a battle, but the generals on
both sides where slain; and the death of their greatest
nuisance at home, and their worst enemy abroad, was an
ample recompense for the injury incurred by his rashness.
“When both Cleon and Brasidas were slain, the
which on either side were most opposite to the peace:
the one for that he had good success and honour in the
war; the other, because in quiet times his evil actions
would the more appear, and his calumniations be the less
believed,”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> peace, though of brief duration, was almost
immediately concluded.</p>

<p>That Cleon should have succeeded to the influence of
Pericles may well surprise the reader. But a very
slight inequality will turn the course of a rapid current
to the undermining of its own banks; and in like
manner, when men’s minds are deeply moved, things in
quiet times contemptible may acquire influence and importance
commensurate with the force of that which
they are enabled, by no intrinsic qualities, to control.
By no other considerations can we explain—to justify it
is impossible—the extravagance of terror and fury into
which England was once goaded by a man, who for
knavery and impudence may match the Athenian demagogue,
and who, for some time, bore equal sway over
the minds of his countrymen, Titus Oates, the discoverer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and probably the inventor of the Popish Plot.
Some excuse is to be found in the political circumstances
of the times; in the belief that the King adhered
secretly to the Romish faith, as the Duke of York
openly professed it; and especially in the known fact
that the sovereign of Britain was pensioned by France,
that he might dispense with parliaments, and the more
easily establish himself on an absolute throne. The
high character of many who promoted the inquiry is a
sufficient warrant that they were actuated by no unworthy
motives. But the revolting narrative of murders
committed under form of law by perjured witnesses and
corrupt judges, will remain for ever a blot in our history;
a warning against adding gall to bitterness; against
aggravating political dissension by religious discord.</p>

<p>The first information of the plot was given by one
Dr. Tongue, in August, 1678; but the King, who was
by no means deficient in penetration, pronounced it to
be a forgery, and it might have slept for ever, had not
the Duke of York, whose confessor was implicated,
judged an inquiry necessary to clear himself from all
suspicion. Tongue professed to have his information
from Oates, and having brought the principal actor on
the stage, took no further part in the action of the piece.
On Michaelmas&ndash;eve Oates was examined before the
council, and deposed to the existence of a most extensive
conspiracy among the Jesuits to murder the King. He
indicated Coleman, formerly secretary to the Duke of
York, and at that time to the Duchess, as being
acquainted with all the schemes under consideration.
The effect of this announcement is thus described by a
most amiable and unprejudiced contemporary.</p>

<p>“October 1, 1678. The parliament and the whole
nation were alarmed about a conspiracy of some eminent
Papists, for the destruction of the King, and introduction
of Popery, discovered by one Oates and Dr. Tongue,
which last I knew. I went to see and converse with
him at Whitehall, with Mr. Oates, one that was lately
an apostate to the church of Rome, and now returned
again with this discovery. He seemed to be a bold man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and, in my thoughts, furiously indiscreet; but every
body believed what he said, and it quite changed the
genius and motions of the parliament, growing now
corrupt, and interested with long sitting and court practices:
but with all this, Popery would not go down. This
discovery turned them all as one man against it, and
nothing was done but to find out the depth of this.
Gates was encouraged, and every thing he affirmed taken
for gospel. The truth is, the Roman Catholics were
exceedingly bold and busy everywhere, since the Duke
forbore to go any longer to the chapel.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Coleman had notice of his danger, and secreted a part,
but not the whole, of his papers. The remainder were
seized, and clearly proved that he had maintained a
correspondence with the confessor of Louis XIV., the
object of which was the reconversion of England.
Besides appearing before the council, Gates made oath
to the truth of his Narrative, which he published before
Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, a zealous Protestant, and active
justice of peace, and yet one that lived on good terms
both with Non&ndash;conformists and Papists. Very shortly
afterwards Godfrey was murdered. He was found in a
ditch, with his own sword sticking in his body, which
had not been plundered; and marks of strangling were
thought to be visible about his neck, and some contusions
on his breast. It has ever been a mystery by whom this
crime was perpetrated; it was of course charged on the
Papists, and retorted by them on the contrivers and
assertors of the plot. But the support given to Gates’s
story by this event, conjointly with Coleman’s papers,
threw the whole country into a ferment. Vast crowds
flocked to behold the corpse; the funeral excited equal
interest, and the wish of its conductors to inflame the
people is visible in some extraordinary precautions said
to have been taken against a danger which no man could
have apprehended seriously. The following account is
taken from a contemporary of high tory principles, and
animated by a most especial hatred of Gates.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pcap">This medal appears to have been struck in ridicule of the notion that
Godfrey had murdered himself; he is represented as walking with the
halter about his neck, apparently towards Primrose Hill, seen in the
distance with its double head. The legend, “Ergo pares sumus,”—Therefore
we are alike,—intimates that those, and those only, who can
believe the well&ndash;known story of St. Denys, could believe the Papistical
account that Godfrey had killed himself.</p>
</div></div>

<p>“The next and last act of this tragedy was the funeral
of this poor gentleman; and if it had been possible the
rout could have been more formidable than at the exposition
of him, it must now have appeared. For as about
other party concerns, so here the time and place of the
assemblation was generally notified, as also what learned
divine was to preach the sermon. The crowd was prodigious,
both at the procession and in and about the
church; and so heated, that any thing called Papist had
gone to pieces in an instant. The Catholics all kept
close in their houses and lodgings, thinking it a good
composition to be safe there; so far were they from
acting violently at that time. But there was all this time
upheld among the common people an artificial fright, so
as almost every one fancied a Popish knife just at his
throat. And at the sermon, besides the preacher, two
other thumping divines stood upright in the pulpit, one
on each side of him, to guard him from being killed while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
he was preaching, by the Papists. I did not see this
spectacle, but was credibly told by some that affirmed
they did see it; and though I have often mentioned it,
as now, with precaution, yet I never met with any that
contradicted it. A most portentous spectacle sure!
Three parsons in one pulpit! Enough of itself, on a less
occasion, to strike a terror into the audience.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>This might perhaps be considered as party spleen: but
the testimony of Calamy, one of the most learned and
amiable dissenting clergymen of his day, and a believer in
much, though not in all the details of the plot, to the
extravagancies committed, is unexceptionable.</p>

<p>“Though I was at that time but young (he was about
nine years of age), yet can I not forget how much I was
affected with seeing several that were condemned for this
plot, go to be executed at Tyburn, and at the pageantry
of the mock processions on the 17th of November.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
Roger L’Estrange (who used to be called Oliver’s
Fiddler), formerly in danger of being hanged for a spy,
and about this time the admired buffoon of high&ndash;church,
called them ‘hobby&ndash;horsing processions.’</p>

<p>“In one of them, in the midst of vast crowds of
spectators, who made great acclamations and showed
abundance of satisfaction, there were carried in pageants
upon men’s shoulders through the chief streets of the city,
the effigies of the Pope, with the representation of the
devil behind him, whispering in his ear, and wonderfully
soothing and caressing him (though he afterwards deserted
him, and left him to shift for himself, before he was
committed to the flames), together with the likeness of
the dead body of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, carried
before him by one that rode on horseback, designed to
remind the people of his execrable murder. And a great
number of dignitaries in their copes, with crosses;
monks, friars, and Jesuits; Popish bishops in their mitres,
with all their trinkets and appurtenances. Such things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
as these very discernibly heightened and inflamed the
general aversion of the nation from Popery; but it is to
be feared, on the other hand, they put some people, by
way of revulsion, upon such desperate expedients as
brought us even within an ace of ruin.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>A few days after these events the parliament met.
“All Oates’s evidence was now so well believed, that it
was not safe for any man to seem to doubt of any part of
it. He thought he had the nation in his hands, and was
swelled up to the highest pitch of vanity and insolence.
And now he made a new edition of his discovery before
the bar of the House of Commons.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> He now said that
the Pope, having declared himself entitled to the possession
of England, in virtue of the heresy of prince
and people, had delegated the supreme power to the
order of Jesuits, and that in consequence commissions had
been issued by the general of that order, to various
noblemen and gentlemen, investing them with all the
great offices of the state. He swore that Coleman, and
Sir George Wakeman, the Queen’s physician, were in
the plot, and that for 15,000<i>l.</i> the latter had engaged to
poison the King. Success emboldened him to soar still
higher; and after declaring to the House of Lords, that
he had named all the persons of rank involved in the
plot, he had the effrontery to accuse the Queen of being
concerned in it, under circumstances the most improbable:
besides that the charge was discountenanced by the whole
tenour of her life.</p>

<p>“It was plain, that postnate to the narrative of Oates,
there was a design formed for cutting off the Queen by
a false accusation, and thereupon this evidence was given,
and Bedloe, another evidence for the plot, chimed in.
It seems the not venturing so high in Oates’s narrative
was thought to be an error to be retrieved by additional
swearing. It was not a cabal of ordinary authority could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
encourage Oates to come to the bar of the House of
Commons, and say, ‘Aye, Taitus Oates, accause
Catherine Quean of England of haigh traison.’ Upon
which the King immediately confined him, and it might
have been worse, if some people had not taken his part,
who were considerable enough to give umbrage that it
would be more prudent to set him at liberty again, which
was done accordingly. The King was pleased to say,
‘They think I have a mind to a new wife; but for all
that I will not see an innocent woman abused.’ This
passage ought to be remembered to the honour of the
King’s justice: certainly if his Majesty had given way,
the Queen had been very ill used.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Oates’s exaltation was a tempting bait, and other witnesses
of infamous character began to appear. In November
Coleman was tried, convicted, and executed on
the joint evidence of Oates and Bedloe. There was
sufficient disagreement between the statements made by
the former upon the trial and before the council, to
cause them to be received with much suspicion; but
Chief Justice Scroggs, after manifesting throughout a
most scandalous bias against the prisoner, charged the
jury in a style of which this is a specimen: “The things
the prisoner is accused of are of two sorts: the one is to
subvert the Protestant religion, and to introduce Popery;
the other was to destroy and kill the king. The evidence
likewise was of two sorts; the one by letters of his own
handwriting, and the other by witnesses <i>viva voce</i>. The
former he seems to confess, the other totally to deny....
You are to examine what these letters import in themselves,
and what consequences are naturally to be deduced
from them. That which is plainly intended is to bring
in the Roman Catholic, and subvert the Protestant
religion. That which is by consequence intended, is
the killing the king, as being the most likely means to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
introduce that which as it is apparent from his letters,
was designed to be brought in.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> It would be a waste
of words to point out the monstrous wickedness of this
inference. The nature of the letters has been already
described; that they contained schemes hostile to the
constitution there is no doubt, though not, it should seem,
such as bore out a charge of treason, least of all against
the life of the king. And it is worthy of observation,
that after dwelling at length upon the letters, Scroggs
says not one word concerning the evidence of the witnesses.
Justice Jones worthily seconded his principal:
“You must find the prisoner guilty, or bring in two persons
perjured.”</p>

<p>The next act of the tragedy was the trial of Ireland,
Fenwick, and Whitebread, three Jesuits; and Grove and
Pickering, two servants in the queen’s chapel. Oates
and Dugdale swore that the priests had conspired the
death of the king, and at their instigation the latter had
agreed to shoot him, which they attempted three several
times; but that on one occasion the flint of their pistol
was loose; on another there was no priming; and on the
third no powder in the barrel: with other circumstances
equally childish and improbable. Scroggs acknowledged
that the case had broken down against Whitebread and
Fenwick, and in defiance of all principles of justice,
remanded them that further evidence might be procured.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The other three were condemned and executed. Whitebread,
Fenwick, and three other Jesuits, afterwards
underwent the same fate.</p>

<p>In July Wakeman and others were tried. “Scroggs
summed up very favourably for the prisoners; far contrary
to his former practice. The truth is, that this
was looked upon as the Queen’s trial, as well as Wakeman’s.
The prisoners were acquitted, and now the witnesses
saw they were blasted; and they were enraged
on it, which they vented with much spite against
Scroggs.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“July 18, 1679. I went early to the Old Bailey
sessions&ndash;house, to the famous trial of Sir G. Wakeman,
one of the Queen’s physicians, and three Benedictine
monks: the first (who I take to be a worthy gentleman,
abhorring such a fact) for intending to poison the King:
the others as accomplices to carry on the plot to subvert
the government and introduce Popery. The bench was
crowded with the judges, the lord mayor, justices, and
innumerable spectators. The chief accusers, Dr. Oates
(as he called himself), and one Bedloe, a man of inferior
note. Their testimonies were not so pregnant, and I
fear, much of it upon hearsay; but swearing positively to
some particulars which drew suspicion upon their truth,
nor did circumstances so agree as to give either the
bench or the jury so entire satisfaction as was expected.
After therefore a long and tedious trial of nine hours, the
jury brought them in not guilty, to the extraordinary
triumph of the Papists, and<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> without sufficient disadvantage
and reflections on the witnesses, especially Oates
and Bedloe. This was a happy day for the lords in the
Tower, who, expecting their trial, had this day gone
against the prisoners at the bar, would all have been in
the utmost hazard. For my part I look upon Oates as a
vain insolent man, puffed up with the favour of the
Commons for having discovered something really true,
more especially as detecting the dangerous intrigue of
Coleman, proved out of his own letters, and of a general
design which the Jesuitical party of the Papists ever
had, and still have, to ruin the church of England; but
that he was trusted with those great secrets he pretended,
or had any solid ground for what he accused divers noblemen
of, I have many reasons to induce my contrary
belief.”</p>

<p>This, the first acquittal, was indeed equivalent to a
sentence of perjury against the witnesses; whose credit
began to be shaken by the contradictions in their evidence,
discoverable by any who would calmly look for them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and by the constancy with which all the condemned met
death, disclaiming to the last the justice of their sentence.
Several trials followed with various success. Soon after
the meeting of the Parliament in 1678, Lord Stafford,
with four other Popish lords, had been committed to the
Tower upon Oates’s depositions. The parliament was
dissolved in January, 1679. Another was called in
March, and the question of the Popish lords proceeded
in; but this also was dissolved in May, without the
accused being brought to trial, and they remained in confinement
till a third parliament was called in October,
1680, soon after which it was resolved, “That the
House will proceed with the prosecution of the lords in
the Tower, and forthwith begin with William, Viscount
Stafford.” Oates, Dugdale, and Turbervile, two more
witnesses of the same class, gave evidence upon which
he was condemned. Stafford was an aged man, and of
little estimation; yet he defended himself, prisoners not
being then allowed benefit of counsel, with dignity and
constancy, through a long trial of six days. He urged
with much force the infamy of Oates.</p>

<p>“Dec. 6, 1680. One thing my lord said, as to
Oates, which I confess did exceedingly affect me; that
a person who during his depositions should so vauntingly
brag, that though he went over to the church of Rome,
yet he never was a Papist, nor of their religion, all the
time that he seemed to apostatize from the Protestant,
but only as a spy; though he confessed he took their
sacraments, worshipped their images, went through all
their oaths, and discipline of their proselytes, swearing
secrecy and to be faithful, but with intent to come over
again and betray them; that such a hypocrite, that had
so deeply prevaricated as even to turn idolater (for so we
of the church of England term it), attesting God so solemnly
that he was entirely theirs, and devoted to their
interests, and consequently (as he pretended) trusted; I
say that the witness of such a profligate wretch should be
admitted against the life of a peer, this my lord looked
upon as a monstrous thing, and such as must needs redound
to the dishonour of our religion and nation. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
verily I am of his lordship’s opinion: such a man’s testimony
should not be taken against the life of a dog. But
the merit of something material which he discovered
against Coleman, put him in such esteem with the parliament,
that now I fancy he stuck at nothing, and thought
every body was to take what he said for gospel. The
consideration of this in some other circumstances began
to stagger me: particularly how it was possible that one
who went among the Papists on such a design, and pretended
to be intrusted with so many letters and commissions
from the Pope and the party, nay and delivered
them to so many great persons, should not reserve one
of them to show, nor so much as one copy of any commission,
which he who had such dexterity in opening
letters might certainly have done, to the undeniable
conviction of those that he accused: but as I said he
gained credit on Coleman; but as to others whom he so
madly flew upon, I am little inclined to believe his
testimony, he being so slight a person, so passionate, ill&ndash;bred,
and of such impudent behaviour; nor is it likely
that such piercing politicians as the Jesuits should trust
him with so high and so dangerous secrets.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Burnet gives his own words: “I asked him, what
were the arguments which prevailed on him to change
his religion, and go over to the church of Rome. He
upon that stood up, and laid his hands on his breast and
said, ‘God and his holy angels knew that he had never
changed, but that he had gone among them on purpose to
betray them.’ This gave me such a character of him,
that I could have no regard to anything he either said or
swore after that.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Stafford died with dignity and calmness, such as to
make a deep impression on the spectators. Their behaviour
was decent, and even compassionate, and a general
belief in his dying protestations of innocence was expressed.
He was the last victim, strictly speaking, of
this impudent and atrocious forgery, upon which fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
other men had been previously executed. Many Romish
priests also were condemned, and, in part at least, suffered
death upon a statute of Elizabeth, making it treason
for such to be found within the realm.</p>

<p>It is not from any resemblance in the circumstances of
the times, nor from similarity of character, though
indeed that is considerable, that Cleon and Oates have
been grouped together, so much as to show that cruelty
and credulity are equally the growth of ancient and
modern times, and that there have always been periods
when it has been easy for men, contemptible in rank,
talent, and character, so they be possessed of a certain
low cunning and a plenitude of impudence, to govern the
public mind by availing themselves of its prejudices.
Diminish these prejudices in the smallest degree, in the
same degree is the liability to this degrading and mischievous
bondage reduced. A startling warning may be
drawn from the comparison of the two periods. Had
England resembled in circumstances, and form of government,
the tyrant&ndash;democracy of Athens, there is
strong reason to thing that the fearful enormities committed
by that profligate city against her dependents
might have been equalled in the extirmination of the
obnoxious sect; as we know that the accusation of non&ndash;conformity,
and the charge of conspiring to establish a
tyranny,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> formed equally ready handles of insult and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
oppression. Happily the balanced and complicated form
of the constitution, and the impossibility of moving with
one accord a great nation, delivered our ancestors from
this extremity of guilt. May the hazard which they incurred
serve as a beacon, to warn men against suffering
themselves to be hoodwinked and goaded by their fears
into forgetfulness alike of reason and charity.</p>

<p>It may be some consolation to any whose patriotism is
shocked by the ready belief of Oates’s narrative, to know
that the proverbial credulity of the English was fully
equalled by the gullibility of the acute and polished
Athenians.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Gross as was the imposture, it was yet not
without some foundation in truth; and in the then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
alarming crisis of public affairs, we may imagine how it
was that eager politicians greedily swallowed a story
adapted to their prepossessions, although candid and dispassionate
observers, like Evelyn, saw immediately how
little of it was entitled to credit. Yet even Evelyn was
partly a believer, as also Dryden, whose party prejudices
certainly did not lead him to side with the whigs.</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">That plot, the nation’s curse,</p>
<p class="ppn2">Bad in itself, but represented worse;<br />
Raised in extremes, and in extremes decried;<br />
With oaths affirmed, with dying vows denied;<br />
Not weighed and winnowed by the multitude,<br />
But swallowed in the mass, unchewed and crude.<br />
Some truth there was, but dashed and brewed with lies<br />

<p class="pr4"><i>Absalom and Achitophel, part I.</i></p>

<p class="p1">The following passages will probably amuse the
reader, and convey a good idea of the character of Oates
himself:—</p>

<p>“Titus Oates was the son of an anabaptist teacher,
who afterwards conformed and got into orders, and took
a benefice as this his son did. He was proud and ill&ndash;natured,
haughty but ignorant. He had been complained
of for some very indecent expressions concerning the
mysteries of the Christian religion. He was once presented
for perjury. But he got to be chaplain in one of
the king’s ships, from which he was dismissed upon
charges of gross profligacy.... He seemed
inclined to be instructed in the Popish religion. One
Hutchinson, a Jesuit, had that work put upon him....
He told me that Oates and the Jesuits were
always on ill terms. They did not allow Oates above
nine&ndash;pence a day, of which he complained much; and
Hutchinson relieved him often. They wished they could
be well rid of him, and sent him beyond sea, being in
very ill terms with him. This made Hutchinson conclude
that they had not at that time trusted Oates with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
their secrets; Oates was kept for some time at St.
Omers, and was thence sent through France into Spain,
and was now returned to England. He had been long
acquainted with Tongue, and made his first discovery to
him.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>“Oates was a low man, of an ill cut, very short neck,
and his visage and features were most particular. His
mouth was the centre of his face, and a compass there
would sweep his nose, forehead, and chin within the
perimeter. In a word, he was a most consummate
cheat, blasphemer, vicious, perjured, impudent, and
saucy foul&ndash;mouthed wretch; and were it not for the
truth of history and the great emotions in the public
which he was the cause of, not fit (so little deserving) to
be remembered.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>“Oates would never say all that he knew, for that
was not consistent with the uncertainty of events. For
he could not foresee what sort of evidence there might
be occasion for, nor whom (it might be thought fit) to
accuse. All which matters were kept in reserve to be
launched or not, as occasion, like fair weather, invited,
or flaws discouraged. And having once said, there was
all he knew (if he had been so overseen), it had ended
the plot, and then there could have been no further suspense
or expectation, as was afterwards continually kept
on foot, in hopes that at length the bottom of the plot
would come up. In the mean time the faction could
calumniate any person, as the Duke, the Queen, and
even the good King himself, as being in the plot, much
more any one that was loyal in the ministry and magistracy,
and so keep all in one. And all the while it went
about in whispers, that strange things would appear, if
they could but once come to the bottom of the plot, and
each one’s evil imagination was to inform what that was,
as will fully appear afterwards. When Oates was examined
in the House of Commons, and was asked if he
knew of any further designs against his Majesty, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
instead of answering that question, he told a tale of a fox
and a goose, that the fox, to see if the ice would bear
him and his goose, first carried over a stone as heavy as
the goose. And neither then nor ever after, during his
whole life, would he be brought to say he had told all
that he knew.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>“Oates was now (the author is speaking of a time
soon after his first examination before parliament) in his
trine exaltation; his plot in full force, efficacy, and virtue:
he walked about with his guards (assigned) for fear
of the Papists murdering him. He had lodgings in
Whitehall, and 1200<i>l.</i> per annum pension. And no
wonder, after he had the impudence to cry to the House
of Lords in plain terms, that if they would not help him
he must help himself. He put on an episcopal garb
(except his lawn sleeves), silk gown and cassock, great
hat, satin hatband and rose, and was called, or most
blasphemously called himself, ‘the Saviour of the nation.’
Whoever he pointed at was taken up and committed, so
that many people got out of his way, as from a blast,
and glad that they could prove their last two years’ conversation.
The very breath of him was pestilential, and
if it brought not imprisonment or death over such on
whom it fell, it surely poisoned reputation, and left good
Protestants arrant Papists; and, something worse than
that, in danger of being put in the plot as traitors.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>“He threatened me indeed with a parliament, but
that is a course of speech he has got. If the prisoners
but ask a new comer for his garnish, the master of the
prison shall be told of a parliament. A bishop shall not
suspend a minister for refusing to officiate according to
the canon, but he is presently threatened with a parliament.
If the university shall not think fit to allow Mr.
Oates his degree, the lawn sleeves are to be ruffled next
parliament. I was walking awhile since only over the
outer court at Whitehall innocently about my business,
and because I did not cap him over the square, as the
boys do fellows at Cambridge, ‘Squire L’Estrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>,’
says he, ‘we shall have a parliament,’ twirling his hat
about between his finger and thumb, with a look and
action not to be expressed.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The credit of the plot and of its author declined
together. In 1681, Oates appeared as a witness in defence
of one Colledge, better known as the “Protestant
joiner,” a busy man and a zealot against Popery, who
was accused of treason upon no better grounds than had
served his own party for the destruction of so many
Papists. The court was eager for revenge, and by no
means scrupulous concerning the means of obtaining it;
the witnesses, who had supported the plot, were indifferent
which way they perjured themselves, so long
as perjury was profitable, and swore against Colledge as
readily as against the Jesuits. Oates, therefore, who
adhered to his old friends, be this one thing recorded to
his credit, was brought into collision with his former
associates, and a scene of abuse passed between him and
them in open court which is too long for quotation, but
will satisfy any person of the infamy of at least one,
probably of both parties. (State Trials, vol. viii. p. 628.)
Towards the end of Charles’s reign, when the discontinuance
of parliaments threw all power into the hands
of the court, and the infamous Jefferies was a ready
minister of oppression; Oates was prosecuted by the
Duke of York for libel, and damages assessed at 100,000<i>l.</i>
This was but the beginning of his misfortunes. In 1688,
soon after the accession of James, he was convicted of
perjury upon two indictments: the one charging him
with having sworn that he was at a consultation of
Jesuits in London, when he was really at St. Omers;
the other, with having deposed to Ireland’s presence in
London at a time when he was gone into Staffordshire.
The sentence passed upon him was most savage and
illegal, and moreover executed with such severity as to
produce the belief that he was not meant to survive it.
It is in itself a curiosity, and as such, as well as for the
instruction of any who do not duly appreciate the blessings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of an incorrupt judicature: though long, it shall be
given entire.</p>

<p><i>Justice Wilkins.</i> “I hope I have not been thought
a man of ill&ndash;nature, and I confess nothing has been so
great a regret to me in my place and station as to give
judgment and pronounce the sentence of law against my
fellow&ndash;subjects, my fellow&ndash;creatures—but as to you, Mr.
Oates, I cannot say my fellow&ndash;christian. Yet in this
case when I consider your offence, and the dismal effects
that have followed upon it, I cannot say I have any
remorse in giving judgment upon you. And therefore
having told you my thoughts shortly about your crime,
and how readily I pronounce your sentence, I shall now
declare the judgment of the court upon you: and it is
this:—</p>

<p>“First, the court does order for a fine, that you pay
1000 marks upon each indictment.</p>

<p>“Secondly, that you be stripped of all your canonical
habits.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, the court doth award, that you do stand
upon the pillory, and in the pillory here before Westminster
Hall gate, upon Monday next, for an hour’s
time, between the hours of ten and twelve, with a paper
over your head (which you must first walk with round
about to all the courts in Westminster Hall) declaring
your crime. And that is upon the first indictment.</p>

<p>“Fourthly (on the second indictment), upon Tuesday
you shall stand upon and in the pillory at the Royal
Exchange, in London, for the space of an hour, between,
the hours of twelve and two, with the same inscription.</p>

<p>“You shall upon the next Wednesday be whipped
from Aldgate to Newgate.</p>

<p>“Upon Friday you shall be whipped from Newgate
to Tyburn by the hands of the common hangman.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Oates, we cannot but remember there were
several particular times you swore false about, and therefore,
as annual commemorations, that it may be known,
to all people as long as you live, we have taken special
care of you for an annual punishment.</p>

<p>“Upon the 24th of April, every year, as long as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
live, you are to stand upon the pillory, and in the
pillory at Tyburn, just opposite to the gallows, for the
space of an hour, between the hours of ten and twelve.</p>

<p>“You are to stand upon and in the pillory here, at
Westminster Hall gate, every 9th of August, in every
year, so long as you live. And that it may be known
what we mean by it, it is to remember what he swore
about Mr. Ireland’s being in town between the 8th and
12th of August.</p>

<p>“You are to stand upon and in the pillory at Charing
Cross, upon the 10th of August, every year during your
life, for an hour, between ten and twelve.</p>

<p>“The like over against the Temple gate upon the
11th.</p>

<p>“And upon the 2nd of September (which is another
notorious time, which you cannot but be remembered
of) you are to stand upon and in the pillory, for the space
of one hour, between twelve and two, at the Royal Exchange;
all this you are to do every year during your
life, and to be committed close prisoner as long as you
live.</p>

<p>“This I pronounce to be the judgment of the court
upon you for your offences. And I must tell you plainly
that if it had been in my power to have carried it further,
I should not have been unwilling to have given
sentence of death upon you, for I am sure you deserve
it.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Burnet says, “But now the sitting of the parliament
of England came on. And as a preparative to it, Oates
was convicted of perjury upon the evidence of the witnesses
from St. Omers, who had been brought over
before to discredit his testimony. Now juries were so
prepared as to believe more easily than formerly. So he
was condemned to have his priestly habit taken from
him, to be a prisoner for life, to be set in the pillory
in all the public places through the city, and ever after
that set in the pillory four times a&ndash;year, and to be
whipped by the common hangman from Aldgate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Newgate one day, and the next from Newgate to Tyburn,
which was executed with so much rigour that his
back appeared to be all over flead. This was thought
too little if he were guilty, and too much if he were
innocent; and was illegal in all the parts of it. For as
the secular court, could not order the ecclesiastical habit
to be taken from him, so to condemn a man to perpetual
imprisonment was not in the power of the court. And
the extreme rigour of such whipping was without a precedent.
Yet he, who was an original in all things, bore
this with a constancy that amazed all those who saw it.
So that this treatment did rather raise his reputation
than sink it.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>So soon as the heat of the plot was over, Charles
reduced his pension one&ndash;half, and ultimately deprived
him of it altogether. After the Revolution he was
pardoned, “redintegrated at court, and admitted to a
pension of 400<i>l.</i> per annum, at which he was very wroth,
for Charles gave him 600<i>l.</i>, ‘and sure,’ he said, ‘William
will give me more.’ He sought by Act of Parliament
to have his judgment for perjury reversed, but he
could never obtain a swearing capacity again. The
Earl of Danby (then Leeds) knew the danger of that,
and would indeed have his sentence reversed, that is,
having been whipped from Newgate to Tyburn, would
fain have had him whipped back from Tyburn to Newgate.
The power of swearing is formidable to great
and small, and his lordship was within an ace of being
put in the plot for Godfrey’s murder.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Here ends his
public life; he died in 1705, having once more changed
his religion, and entered into the communion of the
Baptists. To the last many persons adhered to him,
and considered him a martyr to the Protestant cause.
In conclusion, we subjoin his character, as drawn by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Calamy, whose temper and opinions alike free his testimony
from suspicion.</p>

<p>“Dr. Oates was a man of invincible courage and
resolution, and endured what would have killed a great
many others. He occasioned a strange turn in the
nation, after a general lethargy, that had been of some
years’ continuance. By awakening us out of sleep he
was an instrument in the hand of God for our preservation.
Yet after all, he was but a sorry foul&ndash;mouthed
wretch, as I can testify from what I once heard from
him in company.</p>

<p>“I have been informed at Westminster that Dr.
Oates was a frequent auditor of my predecessor, Mr.
Alsop, and moved for leave to come to the Lord’s table
with his society, but that an honest man of the congregation
upon that occasion spoke freely against him, as
one so irregular in his life as to be very unfit for church
communion. The doctor afterwards meeting Mr. Alsop,
told him that man had sadly abused him, and upon that
account he vehemently complained as one that was
injuriously dealt with. Mr. Alsop cried out, ‘Prove
him a liar, doctor! prove him a liar!’ which it would
have been well for him if he could have done. But he
really bore an indifferent character at Westminster, and
notwithstanding all the service he had done, there were
so many things concurring to lessen his credit, as makes
it very hard to distinguish between what was true and
what was false in his depositions. For which reason I
must own that I am the less surprised, that the parliament
after the Revolution should leave him under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
brand, and incapacitate him for being a witness for the
future.”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>We may conclude the chapter with a short reference
to that most remarkable transaction, the mutilation
of the Hermæ, which occurred <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 415, just before
the Sicilian expedition, and in its consequences bears a
striking analogy to the passage in history which we have
just related. The Hermæ were square pillars, surmounted
by a head of the god, Hermes, or Mercury,
which, in compliance with an ancient custom, were
placed at the entrances of temples and houses. Most
of these throughout Athens were defaced in the course
of one night. A great sensation was excited in the city;
for the circumstance was held to be of evil omen to the
important enterprise just about to be commenced, and
moreover to indicate the existence of a plot to overthrow
the democracy. Alcibiades was accused among others,
but no evidence could be obtained to bring home the
offence to any one: the excitement passed off for a time,
and he was ordered with the army to Sicily. But men’s
minds were unsettled, and agitated by terrors of they
knew not what, aggravated by designing persons for
party ends. “From the affair of the Mercuries, a plot
was inferred for the establishment of oligarchy or tyranny,
and the irritation was cherished by continual discourses
of what Athens had suffered through the Pisistratidæ.
On the slightest suspicion, on the most discreditable
evidence, men, the most respected, were imprisoned;
alarm increased with the number of accusations, and each
found readier credit than the last. At length Andocides,
one of the imprisoned, seeing no other hope of
escape, and hoping by the sacrifice of a few to save the
rest, and to tranquillize the city, confessed the crime,
and accused some others, whether truly or falsely is not
known. The people received the information with joy;
and setting free the informer, and those whom he had
cleared, tried and executed the others. The proof was
very inadequate, and the condemnation most unjust;
but the panic was in great measure abated.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>In this jealous temper, Alcibiades, though not included
in the accusation, was summoned home from
Sicily. He fled to Sparta, and by his powerful talents
contributed very principally to produce those reverses
which subsequently overtook the Athenians. The
account of this remarkable transaction is given in
Thucydides, vi. c. 27, 60, and most completely in the
speech of Andocides de Mysteriis, which is contained
in Bekker’s collection of the Greek orators.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">Athenian expedition against Sicily—Siege of Syracuse—Retreat
and destruction of the army—Retreat of Ney in
Russia—Retreat of Sir John Hawkwood in Italy.</p>

<p class="pn">We now come to the Sicilian expedition, and request
the reader’s patience if we dwell longer than usual on
the closing scene of an undertaking, described by its
historian as “the greatest that happened in this war, or
at all, that we have heard of, among the Grecians, being
to the victors most glorious, and most calamitous to the
vanquished.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The total destruction of the army of
Athens struck a deadly blow at her greatness, though
she struggled most energetically to retrieve her loss, and,
through the want of able leaders at Sparta, nearly succeeded.
But the scale was turned against her, and from
this time forwards she fought an uphill battle.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth year of the war, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 415, the
Athenians, at the suggestion of Alcibiades, resolved to
send a very powerful armament to Sicily, nominally to
protect the little republic of Egesta against Selinus and
Syracuse, but really to re&ndash;establish the Ionian interest in
the island. We may observe that Sicily was colonized
partly by Ionian, partly by Dorian Greeks, and that the
former naturally favoured the Athenians, the latter the
Lacedæmonians, as the heads of their respective races.
At present the Dorian race, at the head of which stood
Syracuse, was by far the more powerful: and alarm was
felt, or at least pretended, that unless checked by a
powerful diversion at home, they might get all Sicily
into their hands, and then unite with their Peloponnesian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
kinsmen to pull down that object of universal jealousy,
the Athenian empire. Moved therefore by the entreaties
of the Egestans, by these political arguments,
and most of all by the desire of conquest, the Athenians
“resolved to go again to Sicily, and if they could,
wholly to subdue it, being for the most part ignorant
both of the greatness of the island and of the multitude
of people, as well Greeks as Barbarians, that inhabited
the same, and that they undertook a war, not much less
than the war against the Peloponnesians.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Nicias, of whose cautious and unenterprising temper
we have before spoken, saw and remonstrated against
the impolicy of hazarding the flower of the state in a
distant and dangerous warfare, while many of its revolted
subjects remained unsubdued: but his warning
was unheeded, and he was required, in conjunction with
Alcibiades and Lamachus, to assume the command of
this expedition, which he so entirely disapproved.
Nicias, a man of courage in the field, was too timid to
struggle against the popular will: he submitted, but still
endeavoured to damp the eagerness of his countrymen,
by exaggerating the force requisite to ensure success. A
hundred triremes, he said, with 5000 heavy armed infantry,
and archers and slingers in proportion, were the
least they could send. Here he rather overshot himself;
the force demanded was immediately voted, and no
further pretext for dissuasion or denial remained. The
armament, including the crews of the triremes, is estimated
by Mitford to have contained at least 30,000 men.</p>

<p>Never was an enterprise undertaken with better will.
Those who were engaged in it vied with each other in
the splendour of their armour and equipment, and far
from finding any difficulty to complete the levy, the
whole of the citizens would willingly have gone in a
body; “the old men, upon hope to subdue the place
they went to, or that at least so great a power could not
miscarry; and the young men, upon desire to see a
foreign country, and to gaze, making little doubt but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
return with safety. As for the common sort, and the
soldiers, they made account to gain by it not only their
wages for the time, but also so to amplify the state in
power as that their stipend should endure for ever. So
that, through the vehement desire thereunto of the most,
they also that liked it not, for fear, if they held up their
hands against it, to be thought evil affected to the state,
were content to let it pass.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>“The summer being now half spent, they put to sea
for Sicily. The Athenians themselves, and as many of
their confederates as were at Athens upon the day appointed,
betimes in the morning came down into
Peiræus, and went aboard to take sea. With them
came down in a manner the whole multitude of the city,
as well inhabitants as strangers: the inhabitants, to
follow after such as belonged unto them, some their
friends, some their kinsmen, and some their children:
filled both with hope and lamentations; hope of conquering
what they went for, and lamentation as being in
doubt whether ever they should see each other any
more, considering what a way they were to go from
their own territory.</p>

<p>“And now when they were to leave one another to
danger, they apprehended the greatness of the same
more than they had done before, when they decreed the
expedition. Nevertheless their present strength, by the
abundance of every thing before their eyes prepared for
the journey, gave them heart again in beholding it. But
the strangers and other multitude came only to see the
show, as of a worthy and incredible design. For this
preparation, being the first Grecian power that ever
went out of Greece from one only city, was the most
sumptuous and the most glorious of all that ever had
been set forth before it, to that day.</p>

<p>“For the shipping, it was elaborate with a great deal
of cost, both of the captains<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> of galleys, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
city. For the state allowed a drachma<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> a day to every
mariner, and gave of unequipped galleys sixty swift
ships of war and forty transports for the conveyance of
soldiers. And the captains of galleys both put into
them the most able servants,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and besides the wages of
the state, unto the [uppermost bank of oars, called the]
Thranitæ,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and to the servants, gave somewhat of
their own; and bestowed great cost otherwise every
one upon his own galley, both in the badges<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and
other rigging, each one striving to the utmost to have
his galley, both in some ornament, and also in swiftness,
to exceed the rest.</p>

<p>“And for the land forces, they were levied with exceeding
great choice, and every man endeavoured to
excel his fellow in the bravery of his arms and utensils
that belonged to his person. Insomuch as amongst
themselves it begat quarrel about whose office should be
the most bravely filled, but amongst other Grecians a
conceit that it was an ostentation rather of their power
and riches, than a preparation against an enemy. For if
a man enter into account of the expense, as well of the
public as of private men that went the voyage; namely,
of the public, what was spent already in the business,
and what was to be given to the commanders to carry
with them; and of private men, what every one had bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and had still to bestow upon his person, and
every captain on his galley; and beside what every one
was likely, over and above his allowance from the state,
to expend on provision for so long a warfare; and what
men carried with them on trading speculations, both
soldiers and merchants, he will find the whole sum carried
out of the city to amount to a great many talents.
And the armament was no less noised for the strange
boldness of the attempt, and gloriousness of the show,
than for its superiority over those against whom it was to
go, for the length of the voyage, and for that it was
undertaken with so vast future hopes, in respect of their
present power.</p>

<p>“After they were all aboard, and all things laid in
that they meant to carry with them, silence was commanded
by the trumpet; and after the wine had been
carried about to the whole army, and all, as well the
generals as the soldiers, had poured libations out of gold
and silver cups, they made their prayers, such as by the
law were appointed for before their taking sea; not in
every galley apart, but all together, the herald pronouncing
them: and the company from the shore, both
of the city and whosoever else wished them well, prayed
with them. And when they had sung the Pæan, and
ended the health, they put forth to sea.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>For the actions and fortunes of the expedition, we must
refer the reader to the History of Greece, contenting
ourselves with such a mere outline as may render the
termination of it, with which alone we are concerned, intelligible.
Alcibiades was recalled almost immediately,
in consequence of the jealousy excited by the mutilation
of the Hermæ; Lamachus was killed in battle, and thus
Nicias was left in the sole charge of an enterprise of
which he disapproved and despaired. The first campaign
was wasted in inactivity. In the second, siege was laid
to Syracuse, a city of large extent and great natural
strength; and all promised fairly for success until Gylippus,
a Spartan of the royal blood, arrived with 700<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Lacedæmonians, broke through the besiegers’ lines, and
threw himself into the city. This reinforcement, and
the skill and enterprise of the Spartan general, turned
the fortune of the siege, which from thenceforth is a
series of disasters. In the following winter, Nicias,
weary of his command and broken in health, sent home
to represent the unpromising situation of affairs, and to
request leave to resign; but he received in answer an injunction
to remain, with the assurance that powerful
succours should be sent out. Accordingly, early in the
spring, Demosthenes, the victor at Pylos, was despatched
with a strong reinforcement, consisting of seventy&ndash;three
triremes and about 5000 heavy&ndash;armed infantry. That
able general made one powerful attempt to change the
fortune of the siege, and on its failure recommended an
immediate retreat. But Nicias, who was brave enough
in the field, but very deficient in moral courage, dared
not to return unauthorized by the people. He retained
his station, therefore, though hopeless of success, except
from the exertions of some malcontent Syracusans with
whom he maintained correspondence. Meanwhile the
army was wasting under sickness, arising from the low
and marshy ground on which it was encamped: and the
Syracusans eagerly prosecuted their success, and at last
cut off from the besiegers the possibility of retreating by
sea, by utterly defeating the Athenian fleet. To act any
longer on the offensive was out of the question; the
only hope of safety was instantly to break up the siege
and march into the interior, where the army, yet powerful,
might find among the friendly Sicels, a native race
who still occupied the interior of the island, a safe and
plentiful retreat until assistance could be sent them, or
further measures concerted.</p>

<p>“It was a lamentable departure, not only for one
point of their condition, that they marched away with
the loss of their whole fleet, and that instead of their
great hopes, they had endangered both themselves and
the state, but also for the dolorous objects which were
presented both to the eye and mind of every of them in
particular in the leaving of their camp. For the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
lying unburied, when any one saw his friend on the
ground, it struck him at once both with fear and grief.
But the living that were sick or wounded, both grieved
them more than the dead, and were more miserable. For
with entreaties and lamentations they put them to a
stand, pleading to be taken along by whomsoever they
saw of their followers or familiars, and hanging on the
necks of their comrades, and following as far as they
were able. And if the strength of any person failed
him, it was not with few entreaties or little lamentation
that he was there left. Insomuch as the whole army,
filled with tears, and irresolute, could hardly get away,
though the place were hostile, and they had suffered already,
and feared to suffer in the future more than with
tears could be expressed, but hung down their heads and
generally blamed themselves. For they seemed nothing
else but even the people of some great city expunged
by siege, and making their escape. For the whole
number that marched were no less one with another
than 40,000 men. Of which not only the ordinary sort
carried every one what he thought he should have occasion
to use, but also the heavy infantry and horsemen,
contrary to their custom, carried their victuals under
their arms, partly for want, and partly for distrust of
their servants,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> who from time to time ran over to the
enemy; but at this time went the greatest number: and
yet what they carried was not enough to serve the
turn. For not a jot more provision was left remaining in
the camp. Moreover the sufferings of others, and that
equal division of misery, which is some alleviation in
that we suffer with many, were not now thought to contain
even thus much of relief. And the rather, because
they considered from what splendour and glory which
they enjoyed before, into how low an estate they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
now fallen: for never had so great a reverse befallen a
Grecian army. For whereas they came with purpose to
enslave others, they departed in greater fear of being
made slaves themselves; and instead of prayers and
hymns of victory, with which they put to sea, they abandoned
their undertaking with sounds of very different
signification; and whereas they came out seamen, they
departed landmen, and relied not upon their naval forces,
but upon their men of arms. Nevertheless, in respect
of the great danger yet hanging over them, these present
miseries seemed all but tolerable.</p>

<p>“Nicias perceiving the army to be dejected, and the
great change that was in it, came up to the ranks, and
encouraged and comforted them, as far as for the present
means he was able. And as he went from part to part,
he exalted his voice more and more, both as being earnest
in his exhortation, and because also he desired that
the benefit of his words might reach as far might be.</p>

<p>“‘Athenians and confederates, we must hope still
even in our present estate. Men have been saved ere
now from greater dangers than these are. Nor ought
you too much to accuse yourselves, either for your losses
past, or the undeserved miseries we are now in. Even
I myself that have the advantage of none of you in
strength of body (for you see under what sickness I now
labour), nor am thought inferior to any of you for prosperity
past, either in respect of my own private person
or otherwise, am nevertheless now in as much danger as
the meanest of you. And yet I have worshipped the
gods frequently, according to the law, and lived justly
and unblamably towards men. For which cause, my hope
is still confident of the future; though these calamities,
as being not according to the measure of our desert, do
indeed make me fear. But they may perhaps cease.
For both the enemies have already had sufficient fortune,
and the gods, if any of them have been displeased
with our voyage, have already sufficiently punished us.
Others have invaded their neighbours as well as we;
and as their offence, which proceeded of human infirmity,
so their punishment also hath been tolerable. And we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
have reason now both to hope for more favour from the
gods (for our case deserveth their pity rather than their
hatred), and also not to despair of ourselves, seeing how
good and how many men of arms you are, marching together
in order of battle. Make account of this, that
wheresoever you please to sit down, there presently of
yourselves you are a city, such as not any other city in
Sicily can easily sustain if you assault, or remove if you
be once seated. Now for your march, that it may be safe
and orderly, look to it yourselves, making no other account
any of you, but what place soever he shall be forced to
fight in, the same if he win it will be his country and
his walls. March you must with diligence, both night
and day alike, for our victual is short; and if we can
but reach some amicable territory of the Siculi (for
these are still firm to us for fear of the Syracusans), then
you may think yourselves secure. And notice has been
sent to them with directions to meet us, and to bring us
forth some supplies of victual. In sum, soldiers, let me
tell you, it is necessary that you be valiant; for there is
no place near where, being cowards, you can possibly be
saved. Whereas, if you escape through the enemies at
this time, you may every one see again whatsoever anywhere
he most desires, and the Athenians may re&ndash;erect
the great power of their city, how low soever fallen.
For the men, not the walls nor the empty galleys, are
the city.’</p>

<p>“Nicias, as he used this hortative, went withal about
the army, and restored order wherever he saw it
straggling, or the ranks broken. Demosthenes having
spoken to the same or like purpose, did as much to
those soldiers under him; and they marched forward,
those with Nicias in a square battalion, and then those
with Demosthenes in the rear. And the men of
arms received those that carried the baggage, and
the other multitude, within them. And when they
were come to the ford of the river Anapus, they
there found certain of the Syracusans and their confederates
embattled against them on the bank, but
these they put to flight, and having won the passage,
marched forward. But the Syracusan horsemen pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
still upon them, and their light&ndash;armed plied them with
their darts in the flank. This day they marched forty
furlongs, and lodged that night at the foot of a certain
hill. The next day, as soon as it was light, they marched
forwards, about twenty furlongs, and descending into a
certain champagne ground, encamped there with intent
both to get victual at the houses (for the place was
inhabited), and to carry water with them thence; for
before them, in the way they were to pass for many
furlongs together, there was little to be had. But the
Syracusans in the mean time got before them, and cut off
their passage with a wall. This was at a steep hill, on
either side whereof was the channel of a torrent with
steep and rocky banks, and it is called Acræum Lepas.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
The next day the Athenians went on. And the horsemen
and darters of the Syracusans and their confederates,
being a great number of both, pressed them so with their
horses and darts, that the Athenians after long fight, were
compelled to retire again into the same camp; but now
with less victual than before, because the horsemen would
suffer them no more to straggle abroad.</p>

<p>“In the morning betimes they dislodged, and put themselves
on their march again, and forced their way to the
hill which the enemy had fortified, where they found
before them the Syracusan foot embattled in great depth
above the fortification, for the place itself was but narrow.
The Athenians coming up, assaulted the wall, but the
shot of the enemy, who were many, and the steepness of
the hill (for they could easily cast home from above),
making them unable to take it, they retired again and
rested. There happened withal some claps of thunder
and a shower of rain, as usually falleth out at this time
of the year, being now near autumn, which further disheartened
the Athenians, who thought that also this did
tend to their destruction. Whilst they lay still, Gylippus
and the Syracusans sent part of their army to raise a
wall at their backs in the way they had come, but this
the Athenians hindered by sending against them part of
theirs. After this the Athenians retiring with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
whole army into a more champagne ground, lodged there
that night, and the next day went forward again. And
the Syracusans, with their darts from every part round
about, wounded many of them; and when the Athenians
charged they retired, and when they retired the Syracusans
charged; and that especially upon the hindmost,
that by putting to flight a few, they might terrify the
whole army. And for a good while the Athenians in
this manner withstood them; and afterwards being
gotten five or six furlongs forward, they rested in the
plain; and the Syracusans went from them to their own
camp.</p>

<p>“This night it was concluded by Nicias and Demosthenes,
seeing the miserable estate of their army, and
the want already of all necessaries, and that many of
their men in many assaults of the enemy were wounded,
to leave as many fires lighted as they could, and lead
away the army,—not the road they purposed before, but
toward the sea, which was the contrary way to that which
the Syracusans guarded. Now this whole journey of the
army lay not towards Catana, but towards the other side
of Sicily, Camarina and Gela, and the cities, as well
Grecian as Barbarian, that way. When they had made
many fires accordingly, they marched in the night, and
(as usually it falleth out in all armies, and most of all in
the greatest, to be subject to affright and terror, especially
marching by night, and in hostile ground, and the
enemy near) were in confusion. The army of Nicias
leading the way, kept together and got far before; but
that of Demosthenes, which was the greater half, was
both severed from the rest, and marched more disorderly.
Nevertheless, by the morning betimes they got to the
sea side, and entering into the Helorine way, they went
on towards the river Cacyparis, to the end when they
came thither to march upwards along the river side,
through the heart of the country. For they hoped that
this way the Siculi, to whom they had sent, would meet
them. When they came to the river, here also they
found a certain guard of the Syracusans stopping their
passage with a wall and with piles. When they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
quickly forced this guard they passed the river, and
again marched on to another river called Erineus, for
that was the way which the guides directed them.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>“In the mean time the Syracusans and their confederates,
as soon as day appeared, and that they knew the
Athenians were gone, most of them accusing Gylippus,
as if he had let them go with his consent, followed them
with speed the same way, which they easily understood
they were gone, and about dinner&ndash;time overtook them.
When they were come up to those with Demosthenes,
who were the hindmost, and had marched more slowly
and disorderly than the other part had done, as having
been put into disorder in the night, they fell upon them
and fought. And the Syracusan horsemen hemmed
them in, and forced them up into a narrow compass, the
more easily now, because they were divided from the
rest. Now the army of Nicias was gone by this time one
hundred<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and fifty furlongs further on. For he led
away the faster, because he thought not that their safety
consisted in staying and fighting voluntarily, but rather
in a speedy retreat, and then only fighting when they
could not choose. But Demosthenes was both in greater
and in more continual toil, in respect that he marched
in the rear, and consequently was pressed by the enemy.
And seeing the Syracusans pursuing him, he went not
on, but put his men in order to fight, till by his stay he
was encompassed and reduced, he and the Athenians
with him, into great disorder. For being shut up within
a place enclosed round with a wall, through which there
was a road from side to side, and in it a considerable
number of olive&ndash;trees, they were charged from all sides
at once with the enemies’ shot. For the Syracusans
assaulted them in this kind, and not in close battle, upon
very good reason. For to hazard battle against men
desperate was not so much for theirs, as for the Athenians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>’
advantage. And besides, their success being now
manifest, they spared themselves that they should not
waste men, and thought by this kind of fight, to subdue
and take them alive.</p>

<p>“Whereupon after they had plied the Athenians and
their confederates all day long from every side with
shot, and saw that with their wounds and other annoyance,
they were already tired, Gylippus and the Syracusans
and their confederates first made proclamation
that if any of the islanders would come over to them,
they should be at liberty; and the men of some few
cities went over. And by and by they made agreement
with all the rest that were with Demosthenes, ‘that
they should deliver up their arms, and none of them be
put to death, neither violently nor by bonds, nor by
want of the necessaries of life.’ And they all yielded,
to the number of 6000 men, and the silver they had they
laid it all down, casting it into the hollow of targets, and
filled with the same four targets. And these men they
carried presently into the city.</p>

<p>“Nicias and those that were with him attained the
same day to the river Erineus, which passing, he caused
his army to sit down upon a certain ground, more elevated
than the rest; where the Syracusans the next day
overtook and told him, that those with Demosthenes had
yielded themselves, and willed him to do the like. But
he, not believing it, took truce for a horseman to inquire
the truth. Upon return of the horseman, and word that
they had yielded, he sent a herald to Gylippus and the
Syracusans, saying that he was content to compound on
the part of the Athenians, to repay whatsoever money
the Syracusans had laid out, so that his army might be
suffered to depart; and that till payment of the money
were made, he would deliver them hostages, Athenians,
every hostage rated at a talent. But Gylippus
and the Syracusans refusing the condition, charged
them, and having hemmed them in, plied them with
shot, as they had done the other army, from every side,
till evening. This part also of the army, was pinched with
the want both of victual and other necessaries. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
waiting for the quiet of the night, they were
about to march; but no sooner took they their arms
up, than the Syracusans perceiving it gave the alarm.
Whereupon the Athenians finding themselves discovered,
sat down again, all but 300, who, breaking by
force through the guards, marched as far as they could
that night.</p>

<p>“And Nicias when it was day led his army forward,
the Syracusans and their confederates still pressing
them in the same manner, shooting and darting at them
from every side. The Athenians hasted to get the
river Asinarus, not only because they were urged on
every side by the assault of the many horsemen, and
other multitude, and thought to be more at ease when
they were over the river, but out of weariness also
and desire to drink. When they were come unto the
river, they rushed in without any order, every man
striving who should first get over. But the pressing of
the enemy made the passage now more difficult; for
being forced to take the river in heaps, they fell upon
and trampled one another under their feet: and falling
amongst the spears and utensils of the army, some
perished presently, and others, catching hold of one
another, were carried away together down the stream.
And not only the Syracusans standing along the farther
bank, being a steep one, killed the Athenians with their
shot from above, as they were many of them greedily
drinking, and troubling one another in the hollow of the
river, but the Peloponnesians came also down and slew
them with their swords, and those especially that were
in the river.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> And very soon the water was corrupted;
nevertheless they drunk it, foul as it was with blood and
mire, and many also fought for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the end, when many dead lay heaped in the
river, and the army was utterly defeated, part at the
river, and part (if any got away) by the horsemen,
Nicias yielded himself unto Gylippus (having more
confidence in him than in the Syracusans), ‘to be for
his own person at the discretion of him and the Lacedæmonians,
and no further slaughter to be made of the
soldiers.’ Gylippus from thenceforth commanded to take
prisoners. So the residue, except such as they secreted<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
(which were many), they carried alive into the city.
They sent also to pursue the 300, which had broken out
from the camp in the night, and took them. That which
was left together of this army to the public was not
much; but they that were conveyed away by stealth
were very many: and all Sicily was filled with them,
because they were not taken as those with Demosthenes
were, upon terms of capitulation. Besides, a great part
of these were slain; for the slaughter at this time was
exceeding great, none greater in all the Sicilian war.
They were also not a few that died in those other assaults
in their march. Nevertheless many also escaped, some
then presently, and some by running away after servitude,
the rendezvous of whom was Catana.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>“The Syracusans and their confederates being come
together, returned with their prisoners, all they could
get, and with the spoil, into the city. As for all the
other prisoners of the Athenians and their confederates,
they put themselves into the quarries, as the safest custody.
But Nicias and Demosthenes they killed against
Gylippus’s will. For Gylippus thought the victory
would be very honourable, if, over and above all his
other success, he could carry home both the generals of
the enemy of Lacedæmon. And it fell out that the one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
them, Demosthenes, was their greatest enemy, for the
things he had done in the island,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and at Pylus; and
the other, upon the same occasion, their greatest friend.
For Nicias had earnestly laboured to have those prisoners
which were taken in the island to be set at liberty,
by persuading the Athenians to the peace. For which
cause the Lacedæmonians were inclined to love him;
and it was principally in confidence of that that he
surrendered himself to Gylippus. But certain Syracusans
(as it is reported), some of them for fear (because
they had been tampering with him), lest being examined
upon this matter, he should disclose something
to disturb their present enjoyment; and others (especially
the Corinthians) fearing he might get away by
corruption of one or other (being wealthy), and work
them some mischief afresh, having persuaded their confederates
to the same, killed him. For these, or for
causes near unto these, was he put to death; being the
man that, of all the Grecians of my time, had least deserved
to be brought to so great a degree of misery, on
account of his regular observance and respect towards
the gods.</p>

<p>“As for those in the quarries, the Syracusans handled
them at first but ungently; for in this hollow place, first
the sun and suffocating air (being without roof), annoyed
them one way; and on the other side, the nights coming
upon that heat, autumnal and cold, put them (by
reason of the alteration) into strange diseases. Especially
because for want of room they did all things in one and
the same place, and the carcases of such as died of their
wounds, or vicissitudes of weather, or the like, lay there
in heaps. Also the smell was intolerable, besides that
they were afflicted with hunger and thirst. For for
eight months together they allowed them no more but
to every man a cotyle<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> of water by the day, and two
cotyles of corn: and whatsoever misery is probable that
men in such a place may suffer, they suffered. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
seventy days they lived thus thronged. Afterwards
retaining the Athenians, and such Sicilians and Italians
as were of the army with them, they sold the rest. How
many were taken in all, it is hard to say exactly; but
they were seven thousand<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> at the fewest. And this,
in my opinion, was the greatest action that happened in
all this war, or at all, that we have heard of among the
Grecians, being to the victors most glorious, and most
calamitous to the vanquished. For being wholly overcome
in every kind, and receiving small loss in nothing,
their army and fleet, and all that ever they had, perished
(as they used to say) with an universal destruction. Few
of many returned home. And thus passed the business
concerning Sicily.”</p>

<p>A pleasing anecdote, related by Plutarch, relieves in
part the fate of these unhappy men. Many Athenians,
who fell into the hands of private masters, found the
means of procuring kinder treatment by recitations of
the masterpieces of literature, with which the minds even
of the poorest Athenians were usually stored; especially
the tragedies of Euripides, the favourite dramatic poet
of the Sicilian Greeks. Many are said to have visited
him on their return to Attica, to own themselves indebted
to him for liberty, granted as a recompense for
communicating what they recollected of his works. This
is strong testimony to the scarcity of manuscripts, and
the consequent value of knowledge to its possessor.
The same cause enabled these captive Athenians to purchase
freedom, and the philosophers and sophists to reap
such golden harvests from their lectures; literature was
entirely dependent upon oral communication.</p>

<p>Forty thousand men, of whom a large proportion were
veteran soldiers of the second military power in Greece,
ought to have made a better defence. But they were
dispirited, and commanded by a general unequal to the
emergency. Nicias possessed many admirable qualities;
respect for the gods, honesty, personal courage, and
dignity of character when not confronted with an Athenian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
assembly; and they shone perhaps more brightly
in the concluding than in any other scene of his life;
but his courage was of the passive rather than the active
sort, and he did not possess the power of rapid observation
and decision which mark the accomplished general,
and are most especially required to extricate an army
from a false position. So far from pursuing the plan laid
down in his speech, the first day’s retreat did not exceed
five miles, the next was less than three; and when, after
eight days of marching and fighting, the Athenian army
surrendered, it was not twenty miles distant from Syracuse.
Want of promptitude in the first instance suffered
the Syracusans to pre&ndash;occupy the passes. How far the
obstacles which Nicias had then to surmount may justify
his tardiness it is difficult to say. Superior numbers and
discipline in the hands of an able general might have done
much to counterbalance the advantage of position. The
Athenians were placed in difficult circumstances; yet
not so difficult as the 10,000 in Persia, or many others
who have yet lived to laugh at their enemy.</p>

<p>It is not fair to estimate the character of this expedition
by its results, for no foresight could have anticipated
that Athens, the mistress of the sea, would be so
completely foiled on her own element, as that even the
power of return should be denied to her defeated army.
But without judging things by their events, a method
which renders criticism of the past comparatively easy,
there are ample grounds to prove the impolicy of entering
upon such a scheme of conquest at such a time. The
Athenians were already engaged in a war fully commensurate
with their strength, and which their utmost
exertions had been unable to bring to a happy close.
Their wealth and power were derived chiefly from
colonies and subject cities, of which several were in open
revolt, and all more or less disaffected. Eub&oelig;a itself,
the most important, and from its situation the most
easily controlled, of these dependencies, was so discontented,
that to prevent its defection was the first care of
the administration, as soon as news arrived of the
Sicilian defeat. It was under these circumstances that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
they undertook a war, characterized by Thucydides
as not much less than that against the Peloponnesians,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
and having for its object the conquest<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> of an island
about nine times as large as Attica, and inhabited
not by a rude or effeminate population, but by rich
and powerful cities of their own countrymen. The
enterprise, hazardous in itself, was rendered more so
by the length of the voyage, according to the methods
of navigation then in use, which prevented succour being
sent, or remedy applied to any sudden reverse; and
on this hazardous service, at this critical time, a body of
troops was sent, not too large for its object, but far larger
than the state could afford to lose. That their destruction
was believed to be a deathblow is evident from
Thucydides. “Everything from every place grieved
them, and fear and astonishment, the greatest that ever
they were in, beset them round. For they were not
only grieved for the loss, which both every man in particular
and the whole city sustained, of so many men&ndash;at&ndash;arms,
horsemen and serviceable men, the like whereof
they saw was not left: but seeing they had neither galleys
enough in their haven, nor money in their treasury,
nor able seamen<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> in their galleys, were even desperate
at that present of their safety, and thought the enemy
out of Sicily would come forthwith with their fleet into
Piræus (especially after vanquishing of so great a navy),
and that the enemy here would surely now, with double
preparation in every kind, press them to the utmost both
by sea and land, and be aided therein by their revolting
confederates.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Thanks to their own activity and to
the supineness of their enemy, this loss did not immediately
prove fatal; but the result of the war would probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
have been very different, had the lives and treasure
wasted in Sicily been devoted for their country in
some better chosen cause.</p>

<p>“Nick, young Nick, the deacon used to say to me
(his name was Nicol as well as mine; sae folk ca’d us in
their daffin’, young Nick and auld Nick), Nick, said he,
never put your arm out further than you can easily draw
it back again.” Baillie Jarvie’s maxim is as applicable
to political affairs as to commercial and good in both.
He whose fortune is already desperate may stake all on
one cast; for the prosperous and powerful to do so is
madness. Had Napoleon’s ambition not blinded him to
this simple rule of caution, he might have died on the
imperial throne: he stretched his arm too far when he
marched to Moscow. No two persons could be more
unlike than Napoleon and Nicias: and it is worth observing
that tempers diametrically opposite led these two
generals into the same error. Both tempted their fortune
after the hour of success was past, and, when active
measures could no longer be pursued, remained in idleness,
from mere want of resolution to confess a failure by
their actions; Nicias, for want of moral courage to face
an unreasonable master, whose mortification was not
likely to be anywise lessened by being reminded that the
defeated general had always disapproved of his commission;
Napoleon, from his sensitive pride, which clung to
any pretence, however thin, which could conceal from
himself, if not from others, that the victor of a hundred
battles was at length foiled. The celebrated campaign of
1812 bears indeed a nearer resemblance to the Sicilian than
to the Scythian war, and on that account might better have
been reserved for this place. But there is one portion
of it still unnoticed, which displays in their perfection
those military qualities, the want of which proved fatal
to Nicias and the Athenian army.</p>

<p>We allude to the remarkable skill, courage, and good
fortune with which Marshal Ney extricated himself from
circumstances apparently as hopeless as any that men
could be placed in. It has already been stated that
the French army on quitting Smolensk was distributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
into four divisions, which marched on different days.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Ney commanded the last. The Russian army lay in
strength between that city and Oreza, but their opposition
was undecided, and the three first divisions forced
their way past, though with severe loss. When he had
only the rear guard to deal with, Kutusoff came to a resolution
which if adopted in the first instance might
have ended at once the campaign and the reign of Napoleon,
and took post across the road, so as to bar all
passage, except such as should be cut through the centre
of his army. On the second afternoon after he left
Smolensk, Ney came in view of the Russians. They
consisted of 80,000 men, with a powerful artillery. The
two armies were posted on opposite sides of a deep
ravine, which at this point intersected the plain. Kutusoff
sent an officer to summon Ney to surrender, stating
the amount of his force, and offering permission to send
one of his officers to verify his representations by inspection.
While the envoy was still speaking, forty guns
opened their fire upon the French. Ney exclaimed in
anger, “A marshal never surrenders; neither do men
treat under fire. You are my prisoner.” The artillery
redoubled their thunder; the hills, before cold and silent,
resembled volcanoes in eruption, and then, said the
French soldiers, enthusiastic in praise of their favourite
leader, this man of fire seemed to feel in his true
element.</p>

<p>His whole force consisted of only 5000 men and six
guns. Opposed were 80,000, well armed and well fed,
and strong in cavalry and artillery. The French vanguard
of 1500 men passed along the road into the ravine,
and dashed gallantly up the opposite side; but the front
line of the Russians met them at the top, and at once shattered
their feeble column. Ney rallied them, and caused
them to be formed in reserve, while he led on in person
the main body of 3000 men. He made no speeches; he
advanced at their head, which is worth all the oratorical
flourishes in the world. Meanwhile 400 Illyrians
had been detached to take the enemy in flank. The impetuosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of his charge broke and scattered the first opposing
line, and without stop or hesitation he advanced
upon the second; but ere they reached it, a tempest of
cannon and musket&ndash;balls whistled through the column:
it staggered, broke, and retreated.</p>

<p>Convinced that it was impossible to force his way, he
returned to his former position on the other side of the
ravine, drew up what remained of his troops, and awaited
the attack. Russian inactivity (we cannot call it caution)
saved him, as it had saved those who went before. A
single corps might have forced Ney’s position against the
weak body who now defended it; but the enemy contented
himself with maintaining a murderous cannonade,
to which the six guns feebly replied. Still the soldiers,
though falling thickly, remained constant at their posts,
deriving comfort and confidence from the tranquillity of
their chief.</p>

<p>At nightfall Ney gave orders to retreat towards Smolensk.
All who heard it were struck with amazement.
The Emperor, and their comrades, and France, lay in
front: he proposed to turn back into a country which
they had too much reason to detest and fly. Even the
aide&ndash;de&ndash;camp to whom the command was issued stood as if
he could hardly believe his ears, until it was repeated in
a brief and decided tone. They marched backwards for
an hour, and then stopped; and the Marshal, who had
remained in the rear, rejoined them. Their situation may
be thus summed up. Between them and the Emperor
lay an army, which they had tried in vain to force.
Guides they had none: on the left the country was open,
but there was little chance of turning unobserved the
flank of an enemy furnished with a numerous and active
cavalry; besides that the time consumed in such an operation
would have left little hope of ever rejoining the
main body of the French. On the right the liberty of
movement was curtailed by the Dnieper, which flowed
in that direction; its precise situation and the possibility
of crossing it being unknown. Ney’s plan was already
conceived. He descended into a ravine, and caused the
snow to be cleared away until the course of a rivulet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
exposed. “This,” he said, “must be one of the feeders
of the Dnieper. It will conduct us to the river, and on
the further bank of that river lies our safety.” They followed
it as their guide, and about eight o’clock in the
evening arrived upon the bank of the Dnieper. Their
joy was complete on seeing the river frozen over. Above
and below it was still open, but just at the spot where
they reached it a sharp bend in its course had stopped
the floating ice, which the frost had connected into a continuous
though a slight bridge. An officer volunteered to
try its strength. He reached the opposite bank, and returned.
“It would bear the men,” he said, “and some
few horses. But a thaw was commencing, and there was
no time to be lost.” The fatigue and difficulty of a
nocturnal march had scattered the troops, as well as the
disorganized band of stragglers which attended on them;
and Ney, though pressed to cross at once, resolved to
give three hours’ time for rallying. This interval of repose,
even at so critical a moment, he spent, wrapped in
his cloak, in deep and placid sleep upon the river bank.</p>

<p>Towards midnight they began to pass. Those who
first tried the ice warned their companions that it bent
under them, and sunk so low that they were up to their
knees in water. The deep, threatening sound of cracks
was heard on all sides, and those who still remained on
the bank hesitated to trust themselves to so frail a support.
Ney ordered them to pass one by one. Much
precaution was necessary, for large chasms had opened,
doubly concealed by the darkness of night, and by the
general covering of water. Men hesitated, but they
were driven on by the impatient cries of those who remained
on the bank, still ignorant of the dangers of the
passage, and goaded by the constant fear of the enemy’s
approach.</p>

<p>The carriages and cannon attendant on the army were
of necessity left behind, and those of the wounded who
were unable to make their way across. The chief of the
hospital department tried the experiment of sending
some waggon&ndash;loads of sick and wounded men across the
ice. A scream of agony was heard when they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
reached the middle of the stream, succeeded by a deep
silence. The ice had given way, and all perished except one
officer, severely wounded, who supported himself upon
a sheet of ice, and, crawling from one piece to another,
reached the bank.</p>

<p>Ney had now placed the river between himself and
the Russian army by a stroke of promptitude and courage
rarely equalled. But his situation was far from enviable.
He was in a desert of forests, without roads and without
guides, two days’ march from Orcza, where he expected
to meet Napoleon. As the troops advanced, the foremost
men observed a beaten way; but there was little comfort
to be derived from this, for they distinguished the
marks of artillery and horses proceeding in the same direction
as themselves. Ney as usual took the lion’s counsel,
and followed those menacing tracks to a village,
which he surrounded and assaulted, in which there were
100 cossacks, who were roused from their sleep only to
find themselves prisoners. Here the French found comforts
of which they had known little since their departure
from Moscow; food, clothes, comfortable quarters, and
rest. What a blessed relief to men who within the last
twelve hours had been hopeless of escape from death in
battle, and then exposed to scarce less imminent danger
of perishing in a half&ndash;frozen river!</p>

<p>From hence it was two days’ march to Orcza, where
Ney arrived on November 20, his followers being reduced
to 1500 men. He had baulked the Russian regular
troops; but he found Platoff and his cossacks upon the
right bank of the Dnieper, and suffered severely from
their marauding warfare. Napoleon had given him up
for lost; when he heard that he had rejoined the army
he leaped for joy, as he exclaimed, “Then I have saved
my eagles! I have 200,000,000 in the Tuileries: I
would have given them all rather than lose such a
man!”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>An anecdote of similar resolution and readiness, curious
on account of the nature of the danger to be avoided, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
told by the Florentine historians of the fourteenth century.
At that time Italian warfare was chiefly carried on
by hired soldiers, men usually of profligate lives and
broken fortunes, unfitted by the licence of a camp for
peaceful industry, or driven to forsake it by the insecurity
of property in those calamitous times, when he who
sowed the seed had no assurance that he should reap the
harvest. The long wars between France and England
under Edward III. swelled the numbers of these men to
a fearful extent; and the reader who will consult Froissart
concerning the state of France at this period, will
there find a fearful picture of the misrule and misery produced
by men of this description, who, when there was
no regular war to occupy their swords, formed themselves
into troops, took possession by force or fraud of some
castle or stronghold, and lived by levying contributions
on the peasantry, and plundering all persons who came
in their way. Such spirits readily flocked round the
banner of any soldier of repute who offered a price for
their services; nor were men of birth and reputation
wanting to lead them into the foreign market, who readily
overlooked the character of their followers in consideration
of the wealth and consequence to be derived from
their support. Among the most distinguished, and also
the most honourable of this class, was an Englishman,
named Sir John Hawkwood, long practised in the Italian
wars, and at the time we speak of, in the service of Florence.
In the year 1391, that city being at war with
the Duke of Milan, planned a double invasion of his dominions.
The Count d’Armagnac, a French nobleman
of high military renown, was hired to invade Milan
from the west, while on the east Hawkwood advanced
from Vicenza, through Verona and Brescia. The two
armies were intended to unite and lay siege to Milan;
but the scheme was deranged by the defeat and total destruction
of the Count d’Armagnac, and Hawkwood,
who, before he heard that news, had advanced within
fifteen miles of the city, on a sudden found himself in
imminent danger.</p>

<p>On looking at a map, the reader will observe that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the country between the Alps and Po is intersected by
numerous rivers; which, like those of Holland, for the
most part flow at a higher level than the neighbouring
plains, and are kept within their course by lofty dikes.
Hawkwood had crossed the Adige, Mincio, and Oglio;
and consequently when Jacopo del Verme, the Milanese
general, marched against him at the head of a superior
force elated with victory, his situation became very
uncomfortable. To give battle was hazardous, for a
defeat with three large rivers in his rear would have
been utter destruction; and it was scarcely less dangerous
to attempt to cross them, without having first gained
some advantages, and struck terror into the enemy. In
this dilemma he remained quiet for a time, retained his
soldiers strictly within the camp, without regarding the
insults and provocations of the enemy, until this apparent
timidity led them into an imprudent bravado, which gave
him an opportunity of attacking to advantage and routing
them with considerable slaughter.</p>

<p>He judged rightly that this blow would keep his adversary
quiet for a little while, and immediately broke
up his camp and crossed the Oglio without hindrance;
the enemy following, but being too late, or too much
cowed to molest him. He passed the Mincio also, and
was then in a plain, enclosed by the dikes of the Po,
Mincio, and Adige, and lying below the level of those
rivers. The last was still to be crossed; and it presented
greater difficulties than the Oglio and Mincio, both on
account of the greater volume and velocity of its stream,
and because the enemy had pre&ndash;occupied and fortified its
dikes. Hawkwood was encamped on a small eminence
in the plain,—we may suppose rather at a loss how to
prosecute his retreat,—when suddenly the whole of the
low country was flooded. They had cut the dikes of the
Adige, in hope of drowning or starving the invader into
submission. The inundation gained ground every hour,
and threatened the camp itself. As far as the eye could
reach all was water. Provisions began to fail; and Del
Verme, who with his troops shut up the only road to
escape, sent Hawkwood the enigmatical present of a fox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in a cage. The Englishman received the gift, and requested
the messenger to carry back word that the fox
seemed nothing dismayed, and probably knew very well
by what door he should get out of his cage.</p>

<p>“It is generally confessed,” says Poggio, “that no
other captain, except Hawkwood, whose sayings and
doings deserve to be commemorated among the subtleties
of ancient generals and orators, could have overcome the
difficulties and dangers in which the Florentine army
was now involved.” It is not every one assuredly that
would have nerve to adopt the measure which he adopted.
In the middle of the night he abandoned his camp, trusting
himself and his army boldly to the inundated plain,
and shaped his course parallel to the dikes of the Adige.
He advanced all the next day, and part of the succeeding
night, through water up to the horses’ bellies; his progress
delayed by the deep mud, and by numerous trenches
which intersected the fields; and which, beneath the
universal covering of water, could no longer be distinguished
from the solid ground. In this manner he
traversed all the valley of Verona; at length, opposite
to Castel Baldo, he crossed the dry bed of the Adige,
there exhausted of its waters, and found repose and refreshment
for his exhausted army within the Paduan
frontier. The weaker horses, and a large part of the
infantry, perished in this march by suffocation, fatigue,
and cold; some saved themselves by clinging to the
horses’ tails. But the bulk of the army was saved, and
Jacopo del Verme took care not to tempt the waters by
engaging in so hazardous a pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p class="pch">Sketch of the interval which elapsed between the defeat
in Sicily and the battle of Arginusæ—Battle of Arginusæ—Prosecution
and death of the Athenian generals—Massacre
of the De Witts—End of the Peloponnesian
war.</p>

<p class="pn">The catastrophe of the Sicilian army was heard at
Athens with consternation. In that army, besides light&ndash;armed
troops and slaves, 10,000 citizens were lost, the
flower of the republic and its allied, or rather dependent,
states; and the private sorrow from which few houses
were exempt, was increased by the alarming perplexity
how such another force could be raised from the exhausted
population, or such a fleet rebuilt from the
exhausted treasury of the state. It was generally believed
through Greece that the war would soon come to
an end; and if Sparta had been prepared to follow up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
with energy the blow struck in Sicily, Athens probably
would have fallen. But though the project of wresting
the dominion of the sea from her seemed no longer
visionary, as it had seemed earlier in the war, in which
case, deprived both of her territories at home and of her
commerce and allies abroad, she must have yielded, the
Lacedæmonians at this critical juncture possessed no
fleet, and the autumn and winter, which they spent in
collecting one, were diligently employed by the Athenians
in measures suited to the present emergency.
Thus at the close of the nineteenth year of the war,
each party, says Thucydides, seemed as it were preparing
for the beginning of a war. But at this time a
third party appeared in the contest. The King of Persia
had discovered that to supply the Greeks with the
means of mutual destruction was much better policy than
uniting them against himself by measures of open hostility;
and Athens, from its restless spirit, as well as from
the recollection of former injuries, was the object of
especial dislike and fear to that monarchy. From henceforward
the want of a public revenue, which had more
than anything cramped the exertions of Sparta, was obviated
from the inexhaustible riches of Persia.</p>

<p>The seven years which elapsed between the defeat in
Sicily and the battle of Arginusæ, are perhaps the busiest
and most curious portion of the war. Scarce two years
passed before the hope of supplanting the Lacedæmonians
in the favour of Tissaphernes, satrap of Lydia, and
diverting to themselves the wealth which was animating
their enemies, induced the once proud people of Athens
to divest themselves of the sovereignty and establish an
oligarchical government. After a short existence of
four months this government was overthrown and a new
one established, in which the supreme power was vested
in an assembly of 5000 citizens, of which all persons entitled
to serve in the heavy&ndash;armed infantry were constituted
members. “And now for the first time in my
remembrance,” says Thucydides, “the Athenians appear
to have possessed a government of unusual excellence;
for there was a moderate intermixture of the few and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
many. And this, after so many misfortunes past, first
made the city again to raise its head.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Alcibiades,
who had been a main promoter of this counter&ndash;revolution,
was now recalled, and under his able guidance a
series of victories ensued which bade fair to raise the
commonwealth to its former splendour. In the twenty&ndash;fourth
year of the war, and the sixth from his banishment,
he led home his victorious troops, and was
received with extraordinary favour, being appointed
commander&ndash;in&ndash;chief, with greater powers than had ever
been intrusted to such an officer. But the Athenians
had not yet learnt steadiness. Within less than a year
he was dismissed, in consequence of an unimportant defeat
sustained by one of his subordinates, who, during
his absence from the fleet, against express orders, had
ventured a battle; and command was given to a board of
ten generals, with Conon at their head.</p>

<p>In the twenty&ndash;fifth year of the war, as Conon was
passing Lesbos with a fleet of seventy triremes, the
Spartan general, Callicratidas, obtained an opportunity
of attacking him with far superior forces, compelled him
to run for the harbour of Mitylene, took thirty of his
ships, and formed the siege of that town by land and
sea. When this unpleasant news reached Athens, every
nerve was strained to effect their general’s deliverance.
In thirty days, 110 triremes were equipped and manned,
though 20,000 men are calculated to have been required
for the purpose. All persons of military age, both
slaves and freemen, were pressed into the service;
many knights even, who were legally exempted from
this service, went on board. The fleet was increased by
forty ships or more from different allies, and then sailed
for Mitylene to deliver Conon.</p>

<p>When Callicratidas heard that the Athenian fleet was
at Samos, he left fifty ships, commanded by Eteonicus,
to maintain the siege, and put to sea himself with 120.
The Athenians spent that night at Arginusæ, a cluster
of islands between the southern promontory of Lesbos
and the main land. In the morning both parties put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
sea: eight of the ten Athenian generals
were on board the fleet.

<span class="vh"><a name="ill201" id="ill201">ill201</a></span></p>

<div class="floatright">

</div>

<p>Xenophon tells us that the superiority
in sailing, or rather rowing, which had
enabled the Athenians at the commencement
of the war to gain such distinguished
successes under the command of Phormion
and others, was now reversed: and that
from the greater swiftness of their ships,
the Lacedæmonians were more likely to
profit by the rapid evolutions, in which the
naval science of that time was shown;
especially that called the diecplus, which
seems to have consisted in dashing through
the enemy’s line, avoiding the direct shock
of his beak, but sweeping away his oars if
possible by an oblique attack. To guard
against this danger the Athenians adopted
the following disposition of their fleet: in
either wing were four squadrons, each of
fifteen ships, and each commanded by one
of the generals, eight of whom were on
board the fleet, drawn up in a double line.
The left of the centre was held by ten
Samian ships; then came ten Athenian
ships, each containing a military officer of
rank, called taxiarch, which seems to correspond
in grade most closely to the rank of
colonel; next to them, each in his own ship,
three navarchs or admirals, two of whom,
Thrasybulus and Theramenes, are names
well known in the history of the time, and
the few allied ships, which were not elsewhere
stationed. All these were in single
line. We have here a good illustration of
the close connection between the military
and naval service, and may infer that officers
of distinction in the one were not expected
to serve in inferior situations in the other.
The distribution of the fleet will be more
readily understood from the annexed diagram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lacedæmonian fleet was formed in a single line.</p>

<p>Hermon of Megara, the pilot, or master rather of
Callicratidas’s ship, observed that the Athenians were
much the most numerous, and said that it would be well
to retreat. Callicratidas answered, that Sparta would
not be worse inhabited if he were dead, but it was
shameful to run away. The battle lasted long; but
when Callicratidas, who led the Spartan right wing, was
thrown overboard by the shock of his own trireme
against another, and the Athenian right wing gained
the advantage over their opponents, the Spartan fleet
betook itself to flight, with the loss of seventy ships or
upwards. The victors returned to their station at
Arginusæ, their number diminished only by twenty&ndash;five
ships, but nearly all the crews of these had perished.</p>

<p>A double duty now claimed their attention: the one
to save those of their countrymen who still clung to life
upon the floating wreck, the other to relieve Conon and
complete the destruction of the Peloponnesian fleet by
surprising the squadron left to maintain the siege of
Mitylene. We can detect no error in the course adopted,
which was to leave forty&ndash;six ships to collect the wreck,
and sail direct for Mitylene with the others. For some
unexplained reason, however, none of the eight generals
remained to superintend the former service, which was
intrusted to Theramenes and Thrasybulus. But a violent
storm came on, and confined both divisions of the
fleet at Arginusæ; while Eteonicus, to whom a light
vessel had conveyed the news of his commander’s defeat,
seized the interval for escape thus granted to him with
much readiness. Fearful of attack from Conon, now
nearly equal to him in naval force, if he manifested the
necessity of retreat, he bade the vessel which conveyed
the news put back to sea without communicating it to
any but himself, and then return crowned and decked
with the symbols of victory, and shouting that Callicratidas
had gotten the victory of the Athenians. He then
offered the usual thanks&ndash;offering for good news, and that
very night broke up the siege and departed. The
Athenians seem to have been deficient in activity, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
their first information of this was derived from the arrival
of Conon at Arginusæ, as they were preparing to leave
it. They then sailed to Chios, whither the Peloponnesians
had repaired; and having done nothing, returned
to their usual station at Samos.</p>

<p>How it happened that so powerful a fleet, under able
commanders, not only did, but apparently attempted
nothing, in prosecution of so signal a success, is left
entirely unexplained; and we might almost suspect from
the meagre statement of facts, without explanation or
comment, that Xenophon knew more of the matter than
for some reason or other he chose to tell. The Athenians,
he continues, displaced their ten generals, excepting
Conon: but the cause of their dissatisfaction is
not stated. Six of the eight who had been in the battle
returned home at once. On their return, Erasinides
was immediately accused by Archidemus, who was at
that time the popular leader, of embezzling public property
and of misconduct in his command. He was
committed to prison. Subsequently the other five were
also committed to answer to the people for their conduct;
and at the first assembly several persons, with Theramenes
at their head, came forward to assert that the
generals ought to be brought to trial for not saving their
shipwrecked countrymen. The accused made a short
answer (for they were not allowed to speak at length,
as they had a right to do), stating all that had passed;
how they had resolved themselves to follow up their
advantage, leaving Theramenes and Thrasybulus, men
of military rank and confessed ability, to perform the
other service. “These, if any,” they said, “are the
persons to blame; yet though they accuse us, we will
not bring a false charge against them, of neglecting
what the violence of the storm rendered it impossible to
do.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> And these statements they brought forward witnesses
to prove.</p>

<p>This short defence made a considerable impression,
and many persons offered to become sureties for the
accused. But the evening had now closed in, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
said to be too dark to distinguish the show of hands.
The matter was therefore adjourned to the next assembly,
and it was voted that in the mean time the council should
determine in what manner the generals should be tried,—a
precaution which shows that they were not meant
to have fair play, since the form of trial was as distinctly
settled in Athens as in England; but it gave the accused
full opportunity for making his defence, and therefore
did not suit the purpose of the prosecutors. In the
mean time came on the festival called Apaturia, at which
members of the same family and the same tribe met in
social intercourse; and Theramenes took advantage of
the kindly feelings excited upon the occasion to raise a
prejudice against his intended victims, by sending about
the city men dressed in black with their heads shaven,
in the character of relations of those who had been lost
at Arginusæ.</p>

<p>At the next general assembly Callixenus explained
the scheme of trial recommended by the council. “The
people,” he said, “had already heard the charge and
the answer to it (an answer, be it remembered, which
had been limited to a few words), and might therefore
proceed at once to vote. Two vases therefore would be
set apart to each tribe, and those who thought the
generals culpable for not saving the wrecked crews,
would cast their ball into the one, those who did not
think them culpable into the other. If the majority
were of the former opinion, the punishment would be
death and confiscation of property.” At this period a
man came forward with a story that he had saved his
own life on a flour&ndash;barrel, and that his dying comrades
charged him, if he himself escaped, to tell the Athenians
that the generals had abandoned those citizens who had
so well served their country. Euryptolemus, a name
which occurs in history only on this occasion, made a
stand in favour of the accused, and threatened to prosecute
Callixenus for submitting an illegal proposition to
the assembly, and a part concurred with him; but the
majority cried, that it was a fine thing if anyone should
say that the people might not do as it liked: and Lyciscus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
proposed, that all who interfered with the proceedings
of the assembly should be included in the same
vote with the generals. Euryptolemus therefore was
compelled to let things take their course. Still the
presidents of the assembly refused to propose an illegal
question; but they were frightened and overborne by
clamour, except the celebrated Socrates, who steadily
refused to act contrary to law. Euryptolemus made
another attempt to procure the generals leave to plead
their own cause, by moving an amendment to the proposition
of Callixenus: but he failed; the scheme of the
council was agreed to, and by a majority of votes sentence
of death was passed upon the eight generals present
at Arginusæ. Those six who had been unlucky enough
to return to Athens were forthwith executed.</p>

<p>Not long after, Xenophon adds, the Athenians repented
of what they had done, and voted that those who
had deceived the people should be prosecuted, and find
sureties for their appearance. Other civil contests arose,
which gave them an opportunity of escape. Callixenus,
at a later period, returned to Athens; lived for a time
the object of hate to all, and died of hunger in a time of
famine.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>The Germans, by the report of Tacitus, held solemn
and deep drinking&ndash;bouts for the consideration of all important
business, upon the old maxim that in wine there
is no deceit; but they took care to reconsider their
decision the next morning. Some court of temperate
review would have preserved the Athenians from many
heinous crimes, into which they were led by a temper
unusually excitable, and when ruled by prejudice and
passion, less fitted to judge wisely and equitably than
the phlegmatic temper of the Germans, even under the
influence of strong drink. With Theramenes and the
accusers this was plainly a party measure, undertaken in
total recklessness of right or wrong. In these corrupt
motives the people could have no share; on the contrary,
they seem to have been acted on at first by a right
feeling of indignation at the alleged abandonment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
meritorious citizens. Their fault lay in the readiness
with which they discarded gratitude to entertain suspicion;
in the blind fury with which, overleaping all
law in jealously asserting the people’s omnipotence, they
followed a mere impulse, a delusion, which the least
exercise of judicial calmness would have dispelled. It
is true that, when the reign of passion was over, and
they returned to their senses, they rendered such amends
for their precipitance as were then in their power. But
such tardy repentance could neither repair nor expiate
the wrong committed; and Athenian repentance generally
came too late. Prompt in action, both from
temper and from the forms of the state, which required
no revision of a decree of the people, no assent from any
concurring authority, performance followed close upon
resolve. Of the many cruel edicts, repented or unrepented,
uttered by the Athenian people, the revocation
of the decree against the Mitylenæans, by which all
male citizens were condemned to death, is the only one
where repentance came in time. It seems a fitting
judgment that the signal victory of Arginusæ was the
last gained during the war; and that in the next year it
was followed by the still more signal defeat at Ægospotami,
which laid Athens prostrate at the feet of her
haughty rival.</p>

<p>Not strictly analogous to the prosecution of the
generals, but a still more memorable example of the
cruelty and ingratitude to which party spirit can rouse
even a phlegmatic people like the Dutch, the very antipodes
of the Athenians in temper, is the murder of the
brothers De Witt. Both illustrious, though not equally
so, to the elder Holland owes deeper obligations than to
any other of her citizens, except those great captains
who burst the Spanish yoke. These obligations, and
De Witt’s high qualities, are best described by a writer
qualified to do justice to the subject by the affection of a
friend, as well as the penetration of a statesman—Sir
William Temple.</p>

<p>“The chief direction of the affairs of Holland had,
for eighteen years, been constantly in the hands of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Pensionary De Witt, a minister of the greatest authority
and sufficiency, the greatest application and industry,
ever known in their state. In the course of his ministry,
he and his party had reduced not only all the civil
charges of the government in this province, but in a
manner all the military commands of the army, out of
the hands of persons affectionate to the Prince of Orange,
into those esteemed more sure and fast to the interests of
their more popular state. And all this had been attended
for so long a course of years with the perpetual
success of their affairs, by the growth of their trade,
power, and riches at home, and the consideration of
their neighbours abroad; yet the general humour of
kindness in the people to their own form of government
under the Princes of Orange, grew up with the age and
virtues of the young Prince, so as to raise the prospect
of some unavoidable revolutions among them, for several
years before it arrived. And we have seen it grow to
that height in this present year, upon the Prince’s
coming to the two&ndash;and&ndash;twentieth year of his age (the
time assigned him by their constitution for entering upon
the public charges of their milice), that though it had
found them in peace, it must have occasioned some
violent sedition in their state; but meeting with the
conjuncture of a foreign invasion, it broke out into so
furious a rage of the people, and such general tumults
through the whole country, as ended in the blood of
their chief ministers; in the displacing all that were
suspected to be of their party throughout the government;
in the full restitution of the Prince’s authority to
the highest point any of his ancestors had ever enjoyed;
but withal in such a distraction of their councils and
their actions, as made way for the easy successes of the
French invasion; for the loss of almost five of their
provinces in two months’ time, and for the general presages
of utter ruin to their state.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>At the early age of twenty&ndash;eight, the firmness and
talents displayed by John de Witt in public life had
raised him to the chief magistracy of the United Provinces,
at a difficult period, when they were engaged in
war with England, then under the vigorous direction of
Cromwell. That honourable station De Witt held for
twenty years, during which that severe war between
England and Holland broke out, which was terminated,
much to the glory of the latter country, by the expedition
up the Medway, and the burning of the English
fleet at Sheerness. Of this bold attempt he was himself
the adviser. Republican by birth (for his father had
been imprisoned in consequence of his steady opposition
to the house of Orange), the whole bent of his policy
was to frustrate the attempts of the Orange party, who
wished to reinstate the young Prince, afterwards William
III. of England, in the power and dignities possessed
of old times by his family; and as the interests of
William were espoused by Charles II. of England, De
Witt was induced to seek a counterpoise by cultivating
the friendship of France. In consequence of this predilection
the war of 1665 broke out, which, after a series
of severely contested battles, was terminated by the expedition
above mentioned.</p>

<p>De Witt’s steady resistance to the elevation of the
house of Orange of course procured for him the sincere
hatred of the Orange party, who were powerful enough,
at different periods, to embarrass his government; still
for fifteen years he held his high office of Grand Pensionary
of Holland, and at the end of that time was re&ndash;elected
for a further term of five years. But in the last
year, in 1672, the French and English united to declare
war against Holland; a powerful army invaded the
United Provinces, and William, upon whom the chief
military command was conferred, was utterly unable to
make head against them. A loud outcry was now raised
against all who had ever shown any disposition to support
French politics, and De Witt, above all others, became
the object of popular hatred. One night he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
attacked and severely wounded by a party of assassins, a
danger to which the simplicity of his habits, well befitting
the chief magistrate of a republic, gave free access.
For “his habit was grave, plain, and popular; his table
what only served turn for his family, or a friend; his
train was only one man, who performed all the menial
service of his house at home, and upon his visits of ceremony,
putting on a plain livery cloak, attended his coach
abroad; for upon other occasions he was seen usually in
the streets on foot and alone, like the commonest burgher
of the town. Nor was this manner of life affected, but
was the general fashion and mode among all the magistrates
of the state.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>While De Witt was kept at home by his wounds, the
people of Holland demanded universally the repeal of
the perpetual edict, as it was called, by which the Prince
of Orange was for ever excluded from the stadtholdership
of that province; and it was accordingly repealed.
Cornelius De Witt, the brother of John, a man distinguished
both in the naval and civil service of his country,
was with difficulty induced to sign the revocation of the
edict. When told that an armed crowd surrounded his
house, threatening his life, if he did not consent to the
repeal, “So many bullets,” he said, “passed over my
head in the late engagement, that I have no fear left,
and I would rather wait for another than sign this paper.”
Shortly after, this brave and manly soldier was charged
with being concerned in a plot to murder the Prince of
Orange. The informer and only witness, Tichelaer, was
a person of infamous character; yet on such evidence as
this Cornelius De Witt was thrown into prison at the
Hague, and cruelly tortured to extort confession of a plot,
the very existence of which, without such a forced confession,
could not be established. He bore the trial with
unshaken constancy, protesting that if they cut him to
pieces, they should not make him confess a thing which
he had never even thought of. It is said that under the
hands of the executioner he repeated the celebrated lines
of Horace—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc1">
Justum et tenacem propositi virum<br />
Non civium ardor prava jubentium,<br />
Non vultus instantis tyranni,<br />
Mente quatit solida, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p1">Finding it impossible to extort a confession, the court
before which he was tried proceeded to pass sentence to
the following effect: “The Court of Holland, having
examined the documents presented to it by the public
prosecutor, the examinations and cross&ndash;examinations of
the prisoner, and his defence, and having examined all
that can throw light on this matter, declares the prisoner
stripped of all his offices and dignities, banishes him from
the provinces of Holland and West Friesland, without
leave ever to return on pain of a severer punishment, and
orders him to pay the costs of the prosecution.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>From the technical form in which this document is
given in the original, and the signatures appended to it,
it appears to be a literal copy of the sentence as delivered
by the court. We may observe, therefore, that
neither the nature of the charge against De Witt, nor
the extent to which it was proved against him, are specified.
This is strong evidence of an intent to oppress
him to the utmost. Where all is honest, men do not
seek to hide the grounds of their decrees. The sentence
is every way unjustifiable: if De Witt was guilty, he deserved
death, and there can be no doubt but that, could a
conviction have been procured, the extreme punishment
would have been inflicted; if not, he was entitled to a
free acquittal. To inflict infamy and banishment for a
suspected crime, even granting too charitable a supposition,
that suspicion was entertained, was to graft the
worst prerogative of tyranny upon republican institutions.
Yet unjustifiable as the sentence was, its leniency
gave great offence to the people, who were devoted at
this period to the house of Orange, and possessed with a
full belief of Cornelius De Witt’s guilt.</p>

<p>John De Witt meanwhile had recovered from his
wounds, and finding that in the then state of public feeling,
his continuance at the head of affairs was alike undesirable
for himself and unpleasing to the country, he
resigned his office. When his brother was sentenced to
exile, he went himself to receive him on his delivery
from prison, and probably to do him more honour and
testify his own sense of the malice of the charge, and the
unworthiness of the treatment which he had received,
repaired to the Hague in his coach and four, a state
which, as we have said, he was not used to affect. This
bravado, though natural, was against the advice of his
friends, and not consistent with the usual temper of the
man; and it proved even more unfortunate than ill
judged. The people, collected by the unusual spectacle,
began to murmur at the presumption of one suspected
traitor coming in state to insult the laws, and triumph in
the escape of a traitor brother from a deserved death. De
Witt went to the prison to receive his brother, and convey
him to his own house; but Cornelius, with his customary
high spirit, replied, that having suffered so much, being
innocent, he would not leave the prison like a culprit,
but rather remain and appeal from the sentence. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
De Witt endeavoured to shake his resolution, but without
effect.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tichelaer the informer, at the instigation,
as we are led to believe, of some more powerful persons
whose names are studiously concealed, was busily employed
in stirring up the populace to riot. Apprehending
some disturbance, the states of Holland and West
Friesland, which at the time were sitting at the Hague,
requested the Prince of Orange to repair thither with a
military force. Meanwhile the tumult spread from the
lowest people to the burghers, and a furious mob collected
round the gates of the prison in which the brothers
were still remaining. The military force which had
been sent for did not arrive, and that which was in the
city was drawn off by the orders of some unnamed person.
Actuated by fear, or some worse motive, the gaoler
opened the gates, a few of the ringleaders burst in, the
brothers were dragged with violence from their chamber,
and brutally massacred as soon as they reached the street.
We abstain from giving the details of the murder, still
more from relating the unequalled atrocities which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
perpetrated upon the corpses. But they were dragged
to the gibbet, mutilated, and publicly suspended naked
by the feet with the heads downward; and the mangled
limbs of these upright and patriotic men were offered for
sale, and bought at prices of fifteen, twenty, and thirty
sols.</p>

<p>According to one story, the gaoler induced John De
Witt to visit his brother by a false message, and being
in the prison he was not allowed to quit it. A similar
message was sent to their father, but being absent from
home he escaped the snare. The gaoler, it is said, acted
under the orders of a “person of such quality, that he
was obliged to obey.” In this account, as well as in that
which we have above followed, there is an evident wish
to throw the blame of the murder on the Prince of
Orange, or at least on the leaders of his party. It is
asserted, however, that he never spoke of it without the
greatest horror. Charges of such magnitude should not
be lightly made; nor is there any evidence to fix guilt
upon that distinguished monarch. But that there was
culpable neglect, if not wilful connivance, seems certain;
and the proceedings of the court which sentenced Cornelius,
show that the agents of government were nowise
squeamish, whatever was the conduct of their chief.
Nor did William’s subsequent conduct betray much concern
either for the interests of justice or of his own reputation;
for though the states of Holland voted the murder
“detestable in their eyes, and the eyes of all the world,”
and requested the stadtholder to take proper measures to
avenge it, none of the murderers were ever brought to
justice. The flimsy pretext for this neglect was, that it
would be dangerous to inquire into a deed in which the
principal burghers of the Hague were concerned.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>After De Witt’s death all his papers were submitted
to the most rigorous examination in hope of discovering
something which should confirm the popular notion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
his being traitorously in league with France. One of
the persons appointed to perform this service being asked
what had been found in De Witt’s papers, replied,
“What could we have found?—nothing but probity.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>We cannot better conclude than with the reflections
of the greatest of modern orators upon this event. “The
catastrophe of De Witt—the wisest, best, and most truly
patriotic minister that ever appeared upon the public stage,
as it was an act of the most crying injustice and ingratitude,
so likewise it is the most completely disencouraging
example that history affords to the lovers of liberty. If
Aristides was banished, he was also recalled. If Dion
was repaid for his service to the Syracusans by ingratitude,
that ingratitude was more than once repented
of. If Sidney and Russell died upon the scaffold, they
had not the cruel mortification of falling by the hands
of the people; ample justice was done to their memory,
and the very sound of their names is still animating to
every Englishman attached to their glorious cause. But
with De Witt fell also his cause and his party; and
although a name so respected by all who revere virtue
and wisdom when employed in their noblest sphere—the
political service of the public, yet I do not know
that even to this day any public honours have been paid
by them to his memory.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion and the result of the Peloponnesian
war may here be given in a very few words. The battle
of Arginusæ was fought <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 406, in the autumn. It
seemed to restore the sovereignty of the sea to Athens,
and to replace her in that commanding position which
had been lost in consequence of the unfortunate expedition
to Sicily. So severely was the defeat felt at
Sparta, that the Lacedæmonians again made overtures
for peace, which were rejected through the instrumentality
of Cleophon, a popular leader of the day,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> as formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
similar overtures had been rejected by the influence of
Cleon. But the government of Athens, though elated
by success, does not appear to have been such as to render
a continuance of it probable, as far as we can judge from
the scanty records which exist of this period. The
rapid and violent changes which had taken place, and
such acts as the execution of the generals who commanded
at Arginusæ, were of a nature to destroy all
concord and all feeling of confidence; and the administration
again resorted to the inefficient course of appointing
a board of generals to command the fleet. Of the six
who composed it, Conon alone is known to us, except
in reference to this transaction. The Lacedæmonian
fleet in the Asiatic seas was now under the able
guidance of Lysander; and by his good management,
and in consequence of the culpable negligence of the
Athenian generals, the Athenian fleet of 180 triremes
was surprised while lying in the Hellespont at Ægospotami,
and captured, with the sole exception of nine
ships belonging to the division of Conon, who escaped
in consequence of being more on his guard. “After
this Lysander, calling a meeting of the confederates,
proposed for their consideration the question, what was
to be done with the prisoners. Then many accusations
were brought against the Athenians, both for what they
had already done amiss, and for what they had decreed to
do if they got the victory—that they would cut off the
right hand of every man taken alive; and that, having
captured two triremes, one of Corinth and one of Andros,
they had thrown overboard the crews of them. And it
was Philocles (one of the Athenian generals) who put to
death these men. And many other things were said,
and it was resolved to put to death as many of the prisoners
as were Athenians, except Adeimantus (another
of the generals), who in the assembly had alone opposed
the vote for cutting off the hands. And he, indeed, was
accused by some of having betrayed the fleet. And
Lysander, having first questioned Philocles how that
man ought to be treated who had thrown overboard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Corinthians and Andrians, thus being the first to ill&ndash;use
Greeks against national law, slew him.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The number of those who thus perished, according to
Plutarch,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> was 3000—a wholesale destruction, in cold
blood, from which the mind revolts. It admits of no
palliation from the alleged pretext of the violation of international
law; for it is hard to say which party commenced
that system of military execution which forms
the especial stigma of this portion of Greek history, and
it is at least certain that in this stage of the contest neither
belligerent could have a right to upbraid the other
with aggravating the evils of war by unnecessary cruelty.
The defeat of Ægospotami was conclusive. Conon, not
daring to appear in Athens after the example of Arginusæ,
and aware probably that further resistance was hopeless,
bent his course to Cyprus, despatching the sacred
ship Paralus to carry news of the defeat to Athens. It
arrived by night, and the calamity being announced,
“the wailing passed from Peiræus to the city, along the
long walls, from one person to another; so that in this
night no one slept, not only through grief for the dead,
but far more because the living expected to meet the same
treatment as they had given to the Melians—a colony of
Lacedæmon, after having besieged and taken their city,
and to the citizens of Histi&oelig;a, and Scione, and Torone,
and Ægina, and to many other of the Greeks. And the
next day a meeting was held at which it was resolved to
block up all the harbours save one, and to put the walls
into good condition, and set guards, and to prepare the
city in all respects for a siege.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>These were the efforts of despair. Certain of success,
since there was now no enemy to raise the siege, or to
effect a diversion, the Lacedæmonians blockaded Athens
by land and sea, and in a few months the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
people was so subdued by famine that they surrendered
on humiliating terms, shortly after the expiration of the
twenty&ndash;seventh year of the war. The walls of the city
were destroyed; her ships of war, with the exception of
twelve, were given up; it was covenanted to follow the
guidance of Lacedæmon as subordinate allies; and, under
the superintendence of the Lacedæmonian army the democracy,
the pride of the Athenians, was exchanged for
the short&ndash;lived form of government known in Greek history
by the name of the Tyranny of the Thirty. This
state of subjection did not last long, but the history of
the circumstances under which it was shaken off belongs
not to our present subject.</p>

<p class="pn">By strictly adhering to our intention of bringing down
Greek history to the close of the Peloponnesian war, we
should exclude from this volume an event which in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
ages has commanded an unusual sympathy—the execution
of the philosopher Socrates on the false charge of
blaspheming the recognised divinities, and corrupting the
young citizens of his country. But as the life and actions
of this remarkable man belong almost entirely to the
period included in this volume, though his death did not
occur until the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 399, five years after the capture
of Athens, it seems proper to give some account of him
here.</p>

<p>Socrates was the son of Sophroniscus, a sculptor, and
himself gained a livelihood by working at his father’s
profession. But he devoted himself at an early age to
the study of philosophy, and by the extreme simplicity
and frugality of his habits was enabled to give up a very
large portion of his time to that pursuit. In youth he
diligently sought instruction, as far as his means permitted,
from the best teachers of those branches of
education which were in repute. How soon he gained
notoriety as a public teacher himself, is not determined:
but he must have been known before the ‘Clouds’ of
Aristophanes, in which he is a leading character, was
acted, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 423. His conduct, however, was very different
from that of the professed teachers for pay, who,
at the time of which we speak, were numerous, and if
successful, wealthy and influential. He gave no regular
lectures in stated periods and places, he required no
money from those who attended upon him, and indeed
accepted no reward, either from those who heard him in
public or those with whom he familiarly associated:
private instruction, as a paid teacher, he refused to give,
though his conversation was habitually directed to the
objects of his public teaching. According to Xenophon,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
he was always in public; in the morning he was found
in frequented walks, or in the <i>gymnasia</i> or places of
public exercise; he visited the agora, whenever it was
likely to be fullest; he was seen in the evening, where&ndash;ever
he was likely to meet with the greatest number of
persons. Instead of saying that he gave no regular lectures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
it would be more correct to say that he never lectured
at all: his usual course was to entrap the person
upon whom he chose to exercise his dialectic powers,
into a conversation, in its outset probably of the most
commonplace and unalarming description; and then, by
a series of skilfully contrived questions, to lead him, if a
pretender to knowledge, to expose his presumption, and
ignorance of what he professed to know; or he would
take a person confessedly ignorant of the things to be
discussed, and lead him step by step in a succession of
questions, until he obtained out of the respondent’s
mouth the result at which he, the interrogator, wished to
arrive.</p>

<p>It would be out of place to enter here upon the discussion
of the abstruse question, how far and in what
respects Socrates ought to be considered as the founder
of a new school of philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Indeed to ascertain
exactly what he did teach, is not now possible. Our
knowledge of him is derived almost exclusively from two
of his pupils, Plato and Xenophon; for all his instructions
were oral; he wrote nothing. Now the memoirs
(Memorabilia) of Xenophon exhibit “not the
whole character of Socrates, but only that part of it
which belonged to the sphere of the affections and of
social life, and which bore upon the charges brought
against him.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> In respect of the more extensive and
abstruse writings of Plato, it is to be said, that though
we may be satisfied that his Socrates, as a whole, is a
faithful portrait, yet it is hardly possible to determine
exactly what belongs to the master, and what has been
deduced from, and engrafted on the doctrines of the
master by the scholar. For what Plato teaches, he
teaches under the name of Socrates: he advances nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
as his own, and on his own authority.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> It is easy however,
and sufficient for our present purpose, to state the
grounds upon which Socrates has commanded the undying
love and admiration, not of the learned only, but of all good
men. There is a well&ndash;known passage of Cicero, which
says, “that Socrates first drew down philosophy from
heaven, and settled it in cities, and even introduced it
into our homes, and made it inquire of life, and morals, and
good and bad things.”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> It is to be understood from this,
not that Socrates was the first moral teacher, but that
whereas earlier philosophers had directed their attention
chiefly to physical and theological questions of the most
unfathomable kind, such as the nature, form, and essence
of divinity, the nature of matter, the origin and constitution
of the universe, &amp;c.; his instructions, on the
contrary, were chiefly directed towards explaining the
duties of life, and the principles on which the conduct of
men in their social relations ought to be regulated. Nor
is it impossible that Cicero’s phrase may have been suggested,
in some degree, by the novel style of language
and illustration which Socrates used, of which we shall
presently speak more at length. To physical studies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Socrates, like his predecessors, had once been deeply
addicted. Failing to arrive at any certain conclusions,
he ceased to apply himself to such pursuits, and bent his
own and his pupils’ attention to questions more nearly
connected with our social and moral duties; holding,
probably, not that these abstruse inquiries were pernicious,
or unworthy the attention of a philosopher, but
that they ought to be postponed until the understanding
was enlightened upon things bearing directly upon the
duties and business of life.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Against those who doubted
or denied the existence of a God, he maintained most
ably that existence, and the incorporeal and immortal
nature of the soul. In his disputes with the sophists<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
and sceptics, he availed himself of a readiness and dexterity
in argument superior to their own; and drawing
them by an artful series of questions into inconsistencies
and absurdities, exposed at once their arrogance and the
falseness of their views. He stated and enforced a
system of morality and religion purer and loftier than
that of the Pythagoreans (the purest sect of antecedent
philosophers); but unlike them, he was accessible to all,
clear in all his statements, as far as possible, and ready
to explain what was not understood. Ever earnest in
recommending temperance, benevolence, piety, justice,
and showing that man’s happiness and dignity are determined
by his mind and not his fortunes, by virtue and
wisdom, not by wealth and rank, his own life was the
best example of his precepts. His honesty as a public
functionary, we have seen tested in the prosecution of
the Athenian generals after the battle of Arginusæ: his
private conduct was no less exemplary. Barefooted and
poorly clad, he associated with the rich and gay as with
the needy, in the same spirit of cheerful goodwill: his
advice and instructions were given to all without fee or
reward, for his spirit was rigidly independent, and if he
possessed little, he wanted less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is a sketch of Socrates, as he is commonly drawn
in history, and known to those who are not read in the
Greek language. We have endeavoured not to exaggerate
his merits; nor must it be attributed to a desire to
detract from them, if we proceed to describe the social
Socrates in a light which may surprise, and probably
startle, many.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The portrait of the philosopher is, indeed,
too generally known to permit them to ascribe to
him that elevated cast of countenance which we associate
in our minds with a character such as that just drawn:
but they have most likely regarded him as sedate, dignified,
and decorous in his manners and conduct. The
picture, as we have it from his contemporaries, does not
exactly accord with such a notion. A full conviction
that what is good is in its nature unalterable, and therefore
cannot consist in anything perishable, had led him
to esteem what are commonly thought the advantages of
life, such as health, riches, pleasure, power, unfit to be
the chief objects of our desires, or motives of our actions;
and he showed this in his own person by an extreme
neglect of the usual luxuries, and even comforts of life.
And he was fortunate, inasmuch as his self&ndash;denying principles
were backed by a robust constitution; so that he
was enabled, when serving as a soldier at the siege of
Potidæa, to bear an unusual severity of cold with an indifference
which his fellow&ndash;soldiers attributed to the
desire of displaying his own hardihood at their expense.
He went barefoot, even in winter; he used the same
clothing, winter and summer; he eschewed the favourite
Athenian luxury of unguents, and seldom indulged in
that other favourite luxury, the bath.</p>

<p>The same eccentricity displayed itself in other parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of his conduct. While serving in the camp before Potidæa,
he is said to have stood motionless for a day, from
sunrise to sunrise, engaged in meditation. The peculiarity
of his personal appearance<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> was well qualified to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
attract notice, and set off his singular habits: and some
of his habits seem better suited to his personal appearance
than to his real character; for in his conversation
(as it is reported by Plato), he assumed a licence which
has given birth to imputations against him, at variance
with the purity of morals which he inculcated, and which
the concurrent testimony of his followers and biographers
asserts that he practised. His favourite associates were
the young, among whom he was most likely to gain converts
to his own opinions, and accordingly he mixed
without scruple in their festivities, and even in their intemperance;
though wine was never seen to affect him,
and that not from abstinence in his potations. The
banquet of Plato, in which Socrates, Alcibiades, Aristophanes,
and others are the speakers, ends with a description
of the festivities being broken up late at night, by
the irruption of a party of drunken revellers, “after
which things were no longer carried on regularly, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
everybody was compelled to drink a great quantity of
wine. On this (said Aristodemus, the relater) several of
the party went away, but he himself fell asleep, and slept
very abundantly, for the nights were then long. But on
awaking towards daybreak, the cocks then crowing, he
saw that the other guests were either gone or asleep,
and that Agathon, Socrates, and Aristophanes were the
only persons awake, and were drinking to the right hand
out of a great bowl. Now Socrates was lecturing them:
and the rest of his discourse, Aristodemus said he did not
remember, for being asleep, he had not been present at
the beginning. But the sum of it was, that Socrates
compelled them to confess that it was the province of the
same man to know how to compose comedy and tragedy,
and that he who was by art a tragic poet was a comic
poet also. And having been forced to assent to these
things, and that without very clearly understanding
them, Aristodemus said they fell asleep; and first Aristophanes
went to sleep, and then, as the day broke,
Agathon. And Socrates, having sent them to sleep, got
up and departed; and going to the Lyceum, washed
himself, as at other times, and spent the whole day there,
and so in the evening went home to rest.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>This is not exactly the sort of scene in which the
great teacher of moral philosophy would be expected to
figure; but according to the best notions we can form it
is a characteristic one, whether drawn literally from the
life, or freely coloured by Plato, who, it may be safely
concluded, would not have invented such manners for a
master whom he loved and venerated. This freedom of
speech and life, combined with his personal peculiarities
and uncouth and eccentric habits, led Alcibiades to compare
him to the Sileni, in the workshops of statuaries,
rude figures which, on being opened, showed that they
contained inside precious images of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Such a
man lay open to a large share of ridicule, and in the
earlier part of his vocation as a public instructor, a plentiful
share of ridicule was bestowed on him by Aristophanes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in his celebrated comedy of the Clouds. At the
same time he was not a person to be rashly attacked;
and those who were most hostile to him, and to whom he
was most hostile, especially the sophists, were for the
most part roughly handled, when they ventured to engage
with him in a contest of wits. Few of his followers
seem to have been really attached to him; but those, to
their honour and his, remained faithful and attached both
to his person and memory in no common degree. But
many frequented his society for a time with eagerness, to
enjoy his subtlety of discourse, to be amused by the
eminent discomfiture which he usually inflicted on those
who ventured publicly to oppose him, and to profit by
the novel style of reasoning introduced by him, which,
if a powerful instrument of truth when used honestly,
was not less adapted, when used skilfully and unscrupulously,
to throw all the notions of a commonplace understanding
into inextricable confusion. It was probably
the latter motive which induced many men eminent in
after&ndash;life to rank themselves, as we are told, among his
pupils; especially three who are recorded to have frequented
his society, Alcibiades, Theramenes, and Critias;
for we can hardly suppose, from their known characters,
that these men, none of them of fair political fame, however
attracted by the talents, and studious to derive intellectual
benefit from the society of Socrates, were in
any degree influenced by the true philosophy which,
under this singular coat of eccentricity, he sought to recommend.
And as Socrates does not seem to have been
beloved <i>in general</i>, even by those who sought his company,
so among the citizens at large he obtained none of
that gratitude which a life devoted without reward to the
public service should seem likely to inspire, except that
those who volunteer their services notoriously get small
thanks for their pains; especially when those services
are directed to enlighten ignorance, or remove prejudice.
Nor were his habits calculated to conciliate favour. His
self&ndash;denial and frugality of life seemed like a tacit reproach
to the idle and luxurious, numerous everywhere,
and more than commonly numerous at Athens. Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the dedication of his life to gratuitous teaching, as he
conducted it, was one of the most unpopular things
about him. If he had given lectures at stated periods to
those who chose to hear him, he might have been endured,
but his life seems to have been a never&ndash;ending
lecture, which is wearisome to all people. Even at the
banquet he would interrupt the song and dance, the
favourite amusements of the Athenians,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> in favour of the
argumentative conversations which he loved above all
things: and whether at the banquet or elsewhere,
stranger or acquaintance, every person who came across
him was liable to be made subject to his moral dissecting
knife, in a way which few would very patiently submit
to. “You seem to me, O Lysimachus,” says Nicias, in
Plato’s Laches, “not to be aware that whosoever may
be closely connected with Socrates in argument, as if by
birth, and may be attracted to him in disputation, is
compelled, though the conversation may begin concerning
something quite different, not to leave off, being led
round and round by him in discourse, before he falls into
giving an account of himself, both how he now lives,
and how he has lived in past time; and that when he is
thus engaged, Socrates will not let him go before he has
scrutinized all these things well and fairly. Now I am
used to him, and know that I must go through all this at
his hands; and that I shall do so on this occasion. For
I rejoice, O Lysimachus, in the company of this man,
and think it no bad thing to be reminded of what we
have done, or are doing, amiss.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Not less remarkable than his appearance, and well
suited to it, was the language in which these familiar inquiries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of Socrates were usually clothed. Constant intercourse
with all classes, high and low, had given him
a store of familiar illustrations, often more forcible than
elegant, derived from the habits and experience of artificers,
whose peculiar terms of art he loved to introduce
in a style which must have contrasted oddly with the
pompous language of the sophists. Alcibiades thus
characterizes his style in the banquet of Plato: “A man
so unlike all others as Socrates, both for himself and for
his manner of conversation, one could hardly find by inquiry,
either of those now living nor of old times; unless
one were to liken him, as I have said, to no man indeed,
but to the Silenuses and Satyrs, both him and his speech.
And, in truth, I omitted this in what I said before, that
his speech is very like to the figures of Silenus when
opened. For if a person should wish to hear the speeches
of Socrates, they would appear at first quite ridiculous;
in such terms and words are they clothed outwardly, as
if it were in the hide of a saucy satyr. For he talks of
asses and their burdens, and of braziers, and leather&ndash;cutters,
and tanners, and always seems to say the same
things through the same medium; so that an unwise or
unexperienced man would laugh at his words. But he
who sees them open, and gets at their inside, will find,
first, that they alone, of all discourses, have meaning
within them; then that they are most divine, and contain
most images of virtue in themselves; and reach to
the greatest extent, or rather to everything, which he
who wishes to be good and honourable ought to regard.”<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
Now the bulk of those who came into contact with Socrates
were unwise or inexperienced; therefore they
laughed at him, as Alcibiades said they would; but it is
quite as probable that a large portion, especially of those
who were entrapped into the sort of cross&ndash;examination
above described, became angry, or, to use a familiar expression,
were bored. We may fairly conjecture that
Socrates had the reputation of being the greatest bore of
his day;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and this in the laughter&ndash;loving town of Athens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
would have been quite enough to neutralize all notion of
gratitude for his persevering attempts to teach his countrymen
that they knew little or nothing, instead of everything,
as they flattered themselves, or at least everything
worth knowing.</p>

<p>Against this man, after he had continued in this singular
mode of life at least twenty&ndash;four years (for the date
of the Clouds informs us that he had obtained some notoriety
before the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 423, in which that comedy
was acted), a criminal accusation was brought, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 399,
to the following effect:—“Socrates does amiss, not recognizing
the gods which the state recognizes, and introducing
other new divine natures, and he does amiss in
that he corrupts the young.” The originator of the
charge was an obscure person named Melitus, (Schleiermacher
reads Meletus,) a poet, and a bad one; but he
was joined by Lycon, an orator,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and Anytus, a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
wealth and consideration in Athens. The cause of that
enmity which led to this prosecution is nowhere clearly
explained. Mr. Mitford and Mr. Mitchell, who both
entertain a sort of horror for democracy, attribute his
condemnation to his known dislike of that form of government.
With this statement, as a matter of belief,
we have no ground of quarrel; if stated as a matter of
fact, we know of no direct authority to support it.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the apology of Plato, Socrates says, that his three accusers
attacked him, “Melitus being my enemy on
account of the poets, but Anytus on account of the artificers
and politicians, and Lycon on account of the orators.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
This passage would rather suggest the notion of
private enmity, which is in some degree confirmed by
another passage in the apology of Xenophon, where Socrates
refers the dislike of Anytus, to a comment made
on his style of bringing up his son.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The causes of
hatred ascribed to Melitus and Lycon must be explained,—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
one by Socrates’ avowed contempt for the fictions
of poets; the other to his equally avowed abhorrence of
that system of instruction practised by the sophists; of
which one, and that the most popular branch, was the
teaching oratory as an art, by which any person could
be enabled to speak on any subject, however ignorant
concerning the real merits of it. This desire to remove
Socrates existing, whatever its origin, it could not be gratified
without finding some plausible ground to go upon.
Nothing could be objected to his actions; as a soldier he
had distinguished himself for bravery; as a public officer
he had shown inflexible integrity, when the infamous vote
was passed for putting to death the generals who won
the battle of Arginusæ;<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and on another occasion, as a
citizen, he had refused, when ordered to apprehend Leon
of Salamis,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> at the hazard of life, to perform an act contrary
to the laws. The real or alleged character of his
philosophy and teaching then was the only handle against
him. Of this, we have already said enough in the beginning
of this chapter to show that it was difficult to
find just ground of complaint against it. But to invent
false charges is never difficult; and those which came
readiest to hand were the same, to a certain extent, as
Aristophanes, in ignorance or wantonness, had long before
brought against him. “What,” he says in the
Apology, “do my accusers say? It is this, ‘Socrates
acts wickedly, and with criminal curiosity investigates
things under the earth, and in the heavens. He also
makes the worse to be the better argument, and he
teaches these things to others.’ Such is the accusation;
for things of this kind you also have yourselves seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the comedy of Aristophanes: for there one Socrates is
carried about, who affirms that he walks upon the air, and
idly asserts many other trifles of this nature; of which
things however I neither know much nor little.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> If
we are to take this literally, it involves the charge of not
believing in any gods at all, for such is the character of
Socrates as given in the Clouds; a charge the falsity of
which is amply proved both by Xenophon and Plato in
their respective apologies. The charge of introducing
new deities refers to the dæmon, or divine nature, by
which Socrates professed to be guided in his conduct from
a child, and which manifested itself by an internal voice,
which never suggested anything, but very frequently
warned him from that which he was about to do. False,
however, as the charge against him was in all respects,
Socrates appears to have felt that his condemnation was
certain, and to have taken no pains either to avert it or to
escape. The orator Lysias is said to have composed a
laboured speech which he offered to the philosopher to
be used as his defence, but he declined it. His trial
came on before the court of Heliæa, the most numerous
tribunal in Athens, in which a body of judges sat, fluctuating
in number, but usually consisting of several hundreds,
chosen by lot from among the body of the citizens.
It was not therefore to a bench of judges such as we are
used to see them, bred to the law, and presumed at least
to be dispassionate and unprejudiced, but to a popular
assembly, that he had to plead. Nevertheless, he abstained
studiously from every means of working on the
passions, even to the usual method of supplication and
moving pity by the introduction of his weeping family.
Such appeals he thought unbecoming his own character,
or the gravity of a court of justice, in which the question
of the guilt or innocence of a prisoner ought alone to be
regarded. Judgment, as he expected, was pronounced
against him, though only by a majority of three. By
the Athenian law, the guilt of an accused person being
affirmed by the judges, a second question arose concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the amount of his punishment. The accuser, in his
charge, stated the penalty which he proposed to inflict;
the prisoner had the privilege of speaking in mitigation
of judgment, and naming that which he considered adequate
to the offence. Socrates, at this stage of his trial,
still preserved the same high tone.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> If, he said, I am to
estimate my own punishment, it must be according to my
merits; and as these are great, I deserve that reward
which is suited to a poor man who has been your benefactor,
namely, a public maintenance in the Prytaneium.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Death, he said, he did not fear, not knowing whether it
were a change for the better or the worse. Imprisonment
and exile he esteemed worse than death, and being
persuaded of his own innocence, he would never be
party to a sentence of evil on himself. To a fine, if he
had money to pay it, he had no objection, since the loss
of the money would leave him no worse off than before;
and he was able to pay a <i>mina</i> of silver (about 4<i>l.</i> English),
he would assess his punishment at that sum: or
rather, at thirty minæ, as Plato and three other of his
disciples expressed a wish to become his sureties to that
amount.</p>

<p>This was not a line of conduct likely to excite pity, and
sentence of death was passed by a larger majority than
before. He again addressed a short speech to his judges,
in which he tells them, that for the sake of cutting off a
little from his life, already verging on the grave, they
had incurred and brought on the city a lasting reproach,
and that he might have escaped, if he would have condescended
to use supplications and lamentations. Of his
mode of defence, however, he repented not, seeing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
he had rather die, having so spoken, than live by the use
of unworthy methods; and that to escape death was far
less difficult than to avoid baseness. He concluded by
an address to the judges, who had voted for his acquittal,
stating the grounds of his hopes that death would be a
change for the better; the first of which is, that the
dæmon had never opposed or checked his intended line
of conduct during the whole of these proceedings, nor in
his speeches had it ever stopped him from saying anything
that he meant to say, as it was used often to do in conversation:
from which he inferred, that his invisible guide
had approved of all that he did, and that therefore a good
thing was about to happen to him. Death, he said, was
either insensibility, or a migration of the soul: in the
former case, as compared with life, he esteemed it a
change for the better; in the latter, if the general belief
was true, what greater good could there be than to meet
and enjoy the society of the great men of antiquity?
Urging, therefore, these just judges to look confidently
towards death, and to believe that to a good man, dead or
alive, no real harm can happen; he concludes, “It is
time that we should depart, I to die, you to live; but
which of us to the better thing, is known to the Divinity
alone.”</p>

<p>Death usually followed close upon condemnation: but
the death of Socrates was delayed by an Athenian usage
of great antiquity, said to have been instituted in commemoration
of the deliverance of Attica by Theseus from
the tyranny of Minos. Every year the sacred ship in
which Theseus had sailed to Crete, was despatched with
offerings to the sacred island of Delos; and in the interim
between its departure and return no criminals were ever
put to death. Socrates was condemned the evening before
its departure, and consequently he was respited until
its return—a period of thirty days. During this time his
friends had access to him; and the dialogues of Plato,
entitled Criton and Phædon, purport to be the substance
of conversations held by him towards the close of this
time. If he had been willing to escape, the gaoler was
bribed and the means of escape prepared; but this was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
breach of the laws which he refused to countenance, and
he still thought, as he had said in his speech, exile to be
worse than death. On the last day of his life, when his
friends were admitted at sunrise, they found him with
his wife and one child. These where soon dismissed, lest
their lamentations should disturb his last interview with
his friends and pupils: and he commenced a conversation
which speedily turned on the immortality of the soul, the
arguments for which, as they could best be developed by
one of the acutest of human intellects, without the assistance
of revelation, are summed up in that celebrated dialogue,
the Phædon, which professes to relate all the
events of this last day of the philosopher’s life. It concludes
as follows:—</p>

<p>“When he had thus spoken, ‘Be it so, Socrates,’ said
Criton; ‘but what orders do you leave to these who are
present, or to myself, either respecting your children, or
anything else, in the execution of which we should most
gratify you?’ ‘What I always do say, Criton (he replied),
nothing new: that if you pay due attention to
yourselves, do what you will, you will always do what
is acceptable to myself, to my family, and to your ownselves,
though you should not now promise me anything.
But if you neglect yourselves, and are unwilling to live
following the track, as it were, of what I have said both
now and heretofore, you will do nothing the more, though
you should now promise many things, and that with earnestness.’
‘We shall take care therefore,’ said Criton, ‘so
to act. But how would you be buried?’ ‘Just as you
please (said he), if you can but catch me, and I do not
elude your pursuit.’ And at the same time gently laughing,
and addressing himselfto us, ‘I cannot persuade Criton,’
he said, ‘my friends, that I am that Socrates who now disputes
with you, and methodizes every part of the discourse;
but he thinks that I am he whom he will shortly
behold dead, and asks how I ought to be buried. But all
that long discourse which some time since I addressed to
you, in which I asserted that after I had drunk the poison
I should no longer remain with you, but should depart to
certain felicities of the blessed, this I seem to have declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to him in vain, though it was undertaken to console
both you and myself. Be surety, therefore, for me
to Criton, to the reverse of that, for which he became
surety for me to the judges; for he was my bail that I
should remain; but be you my bail that I shall not remain
when I die, but shall depart hence, that Criton may
bear it the more easily, and may not be afflicted when he
sees my body burnt or buried as if I were suffering some
dreadful misfortune; and that he may not say at my interment,
that Socrates is laid out, or carried out, or is
buried. For be well assured of this, my friend Criton,
that when we speak amiss, we are not only blameable
as to our expressions, but likewise do some evil to our
souls. But it is fit to be of good heart, and to say that
my body will be buried, and to bury it in such manner as
may be most pleasing to yourself, and as you may esteem
it most agreeable to our laws.’”</p>

<p>When he had thus spoken, he arose, and went into
another room, that he might wash himself, and Criton
followed him: but he ordered us to wait for him. We
waited therefore accordingly, discoursing over, and reviewing
among ourselves what had been said; and sometimes
speaking about his death, how great a calamity it
would be to us; and sincerely thinking that we, like
those who are deprived of their fathers, should pass the
rest of our life in the condition of orphans. But when
he had washed himself, his sons were brought to him
(for he had two little ones, and one older), and the
women belonging to his family likewise came in to him:
but when he had spoken to them before Criton, and had
left them such injunctions as he thought proper, he ordered
the boys and women to depart, and he himself returned
to us. And it was now near the setting of the
sun; for he had been away in the inner room for a long
time. But when he came in from bathing he sat down,
and did not speak much afterwards: for then the servant
of the Eleven<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> came in, and standing near him, “I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
not perceive that in you, Socrates,” said he, “which I
have taken notice of in others; I mean that they are
angry with me, and curse me, when, being compelled by
the magistrates. I announce to them that they must drink
the poison. But, on the contrary, I have found you to
the present time to be the most generous, mild, and best
of all the men that ever came into this place; and therefore
I am well convinced that you are not angry with me,
but with the authors of your present condition, for you
know who they are. Now, therefore (for you know
what I came to tell you), farewell; and endeavour to
bear this necessity as easily as possible.” And at the
same time, bursting into tears, and turning himself away,
he departed. But Socrates, looking after him, said,
“And thou, too, farewell; and we shall take care to act
as you advise.” And at the same time, turning to us,
“How courteous,” he said, “is the behaviour of that
man! During the whole time of my abode here, he has
visited me, and often conversed with me, and proved
himself to be the best of men; and now how generously
he weeps on my account! But let us obey him, Criton,
and let some one bring the poison, if it is bruised; and
if not, let the man whose business it is, bruise it.”
“But, Socrates,” said Criton, “I think that the sun still
hangs over the mountains, and is not set yet. And at
the same time I have known others who have drunk the
poison very late, after it was announced to them; who
have supped and drunk abundantly. Therefore, do not
be in such haste, for there is yet time enough.” Socrates
replied, “Such men, Criton, act fitly in the manner
which you have described, for they think to derive some
advantage by so doing; and I also with propriety shall
not act in this manner. For I do not think I shall gain
anything by drinking it later, except becoming ridiculous
to myself through desiring to live, and being sparing of
life, when nothing of it any longer remains. Go,
therefore,” said he, “be persuaded, and comply with
my request.”</p>

<p>Then Criton hearing this, gave a sign to the boy that
stood near him; and the boy departing, and having stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
for some time, came back with the person that was to
administer the poison, who brought it pounded in a cup.
And Socrates, looking at the man, said, “Well, my
friend (for you are knowing in these matters), what is to
be done?” “Nothing (he said) but, after you have
drunk it, to walk about, until a heaviness takes place in
your legs, and then to lie down: this is the manner in
which you have to act.” And at the same time he extended
the cup to Socrates. And Socrates taking it—and
indeed, Echecrates—with great cheerfulness, neither
trembling, nor suffering any change for the worse in his
colour or countenance, but as he was used to do, looking
up sternly<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> at the man. “What say you,” he said, “as
to making a libation from this potion? may I do it or
not?” “We only bruise as much, Socrates,” he said,
“as we think sufficient for the purpose.” “I understand
you,” he said; “but it is both lawful and proper
to pray to the gods that my departure from hence thither
may be prosperous: which I entreat them to grant may
be the case.” And so saying, he stopped, and drank
the poison very readily and pleasantly. And thus far
indeed the greater part of us were tolerably well able to
refrain from weeping: but when we saw him drinking,
and that he had drunk it, we could no longer restrain our
tears. And from me indeed, in spite of my efforts, they
flowed, and not drop by drop;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> so that wrapping myself
in my mantle, I bewailed myself, not indeed for his misfortune,
but for my own, considering what a companion
I should be deprived of. But Criton, who was not able
to restrain his tears, was compelled to rise before me.
And Apollodorus, who during the whole time prior to
this had not ceased from weeping, then wept aloud with
great bitterness, so that he infected all who were present
except Socrates. But Socrates, upon seeing this, exclaimed,
“What are you doing, you strange men! In
truth, I principally sent away the women lest they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
produce a disturbance of this kind; for I have heard that
it is proper to die among well&ndash;omened sounds.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Be
quiet, therefore, and maintain your fortitude.” And
when we heard this, we were ashamed, and restrained
our tears. But he, when he found during his walking
about that his legs became heavy, and had told us so,
laid himself down on his back. For the man had told
him to do so. And at the same time he who gave him
the poison, touching him at intervals, examined his feet
and legs. And then pressing very hard on his foot, he
asked him if he felt it. But Socrates answered that he
did not. And after this he pressed his thighs, and thus,
going upwards, he showed us that he was cold and stiff.
And Socrates also touched himself, and said that when
the poison reached his heart he should then depart. But
now the lower part of his body was almost cold; when
uncovering himself (for he was covered), he said (and
these were his last words), “Criton, we owe a cock to
Æsculapius. Discharge this debt therefore for me, and
do not neglect it.” “It shall be done,” said Criton;
“but consider whether you have any other commands.”
To this inquiry of Criton he made no reply; but shortly
after moved himself, and the man uncovered him. And
Socrates fixed his eyes; which, when Criton perceived,
he closed his mouth and eyes. “This, Echecrates, was
the end of our companion; a man, as it appears to me,
the best of those whom we were acquainted with at that
time, and besides this, the most prudent and just.”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Such is the narration which Cicero professed himself
unable to read without tears. Its celebrity and beauty
will, we hope, be received as a sufficient excuse for
giving this version of a passage which, as a whole, is
little known in an English dress; for we must confess,
that while history, both ancient and modern, abounds in
events analogous in the nature of their interest to the
death of Socrates, we find none which, strictly speaking,
can be regarded as parallels to it. This arises in part
from our hardly knowing whether to refer his prosecution
and condemnation to private hatred; or to the enmity of
the sophists, and the powerful party which supported
them; or to the genuine zeal of religious bigotry; or to
a political fear that the doctrines taught by Socrates were
calculated to breed up a set of men in too little respect
for the democracy. All these causes have been assigned;
and whatever the motive which influenced his
accusers, all may have had their influence on the judges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
who condemned him, as well as that unworthy pride
which is expressly mentioned by Xenophon<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> as having
prevented the acquittal of his master. Whether therefore
we seek our instances among civil or religious persecutions,
we shall scarcely find anything strictly analogous
to the death of Socrates; and as we have said, it is
here introduced more for the beauty of the narrative than
for the sake of comparison. To that beauty, and to the
talents of the historian, Socrates and his resignation owe
no small share of their extraordinary celebrity. It is
well remarked by Mitford, that though “the magnanimity
of Socrates surely deserves admiration, yet it is not
that in which he has most outshone other men. The circumstances
of Lord Russell’s fate were far more trying.
Socrates, as we may reasonably suppose, would have
borne Lord Russell’s trial: but with Bishop Burnet for
his eulogist, instead of Plato and Xenophon, he would
not have had his present splendid fame.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>The power of meeting an inevitable death with firmness
and composure, is so far from being uncommon, that
our interest in examples of it might be supposed to be
deadened by their frequent occurrence. It is to be
found, the outward show of it at least, in all stations,
from the martyr for religion or patriotism, down to the
humble and profligate sufferer who forfeits his life as a
convicted felon. The fancied gaiety of Captain Macheath
is as true to nature as the cheerfulness of Sir Thomas
More; and the iron resolution of the murderer Thurtell
enabled him to face death as composedly as Charles I. or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Algernon Sidney. Still we do read with eagerness and
admiration of More’s cheerful jocularity on the scaffold,
of the holy resignation of Latimer, and the high&ndash;souled,
yet tender and womanly deportment of Lady Jane Grey.
The subject seems to possess an interest not easily exhausted.
Historians therefore have seldom thought the
last hours of great men unworthy of notice: and the constancy
and dying professions of those who have laid
down their lives for their political or religious opinions,
have always been eagerly treasured up by friends and
followers, as evidences both of the sincerity and truth of
their belief. Yet such evidence is doubtful even in respect
of the former, and null in respect of the latter; for
there never perhaps was a cause important enough to
challenge persecution, which did not find persons ready
to suffer martyrdom for its sake.</p>

<p>In selecting the examples which occupy the rest of
this chapter, it has been endeavoured to take such as,
relating to important and spirit&ndash;stirring seasons, are yet
likely not to be familiar in their details to all our readers.
We do not profess that they will bear a close comparison
with the prosecution of Socrates; on the contrary, we
may here again express our belief that nothing can be
found analogous either to the character or the history of
that extraordinary man. Nor shall we attempt to make
out a resemblance where no real one exists. The design
of this work will be sufficiently fulfilled, if the following
passages of history shall appear interesting: the lessons
which they convey cannot be otherwise than profitable.
The first and third refer to persecutions purely religious
in their character; the second refers to what, under the
appearance of a religious persecution, was in fact quite as
much a plot against civil liberty.</p>

<p>The first embraces a short sketch of the history and
death of two among the most eminent of the early Reformers,
John Huss, and Jerome of Prague. John Huss,
or rather John of Hussinetz (for he derived his name,
according to a common usage of that time, from the
place of his birth), was a Bohemian priest, educated at
the University of Prague. His talents, and the simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and severity of his life, raised him through subordinate
stations to the high office of Rector of the University.
By some means, the nature of which is not
quite clear, the opinions and works of our venerable
Wiclif, the first translator of the Bible into the English
tongue, were conveyed into Bohemia towards the close
of the fourteenth century. They struck deep root in
that soil: a circumstance to be attributed in no small
degree to the effect produced by Wiclif’s character and
doctrines upon the mind of Huss; who conceived so
deep a veneration for his preceptor, that in his sermons
to the people in the chapel of Bethlehem (a chapel
endowed by a pious citizen of Prague, to enable two
preachers to address the lower orders in the Bohemian
tongue), he is said often to have addressed his earnest
vows to Heaven, that “whensoever he should be removed
from this life, he might be admitted to the same
regions where the soul of Wiclif resided; since he
doubted not that he was a good and holy man, and
worthy of a habitation in heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Already eminent
for his philosophical attainments, Huss had obtained another
kind of celebrity, so early as the year 1405, by
these sermons, in which he inveighed powerfully against
the extortions and corruptions by which the papal
hierarchy had disfigured the purity of Christian faith.
He continued to preach, unchecked, till the year 1409,
when the Archbishop of Prague commenced open war
on the new doctrines, by ordering all members of the
university who possessed Wiclif’s writings to bring them
in, that those which were found to be heretical might be
publicly burnt. Two hundred volumes are said to have
been thus destroyed. Huss, and other members of the
university, appealed to the Pope; but, as might have
been expected, their cause took an unfavourable turn,
and the Archbishop was empowered to suppress the doctrines
of Wiclif within his diocese. Huss, however,
with his friend, pupil, and fellow&ndash;sufferer, Jerome of
Prague, master of theology in the university, continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to preach: and the people followed them, in spite of the
combination and determined opposition of the clergy in
general. Huss was in consequence summoned to appear
at Rome. He refused to place himself in the power of
the Pope, but sent three deputies to plead his cause.
The deputies were insulted and maltreated, and he himself
was declared guilty of contumacy, and excommunicated.
Against this censure he published a formal protest,
in which, after reciting authorities to justify the
step which he was taking, narrating his excommunication,
and explaining the injustice and informality of the
proceedings under which he was condemned, he concludes,
“It is therefore manifest that, none of these conditions
being fulfilled in my case, I am acquitted before
God of the crime of contumacy, and am unbound by
a pretended and frivolous excommunication. I, John
Huss, present this appeal to Jesus Christ, my master and
just judge, who knows and protects the just cause of
every one.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>He continued accordingly to preach at Prague till early
in the year 1413, when the Archbishop interposed, and
Huss retired, apparently to the place of his birth. But
he continued to write, and his doctrines were readily received
by the Bohemians, though zealously opposed by
the great body of the clergy. On the meeting of the
Council of Constance, in 1414, Huss was called before
it, to declare and to defend his opinions. He had disobeyed
the summons of the Pope, but he recognised the
authority of the church in its general council, and obeyed
its call with alacrity. It seems to have been his earnest
desire to explain the grounds of his faith, and to confess
his error, if he could be convinced of error, in those
points wherein he differed from the received doctrines of
the church. With this view, before he went to Constance,
he appeared before a synod of the clergy held at
Prague, with the express view of declaring and supporting
his peculiar tenets: and when permission to do so
was refused, he affixed placards in places of public resort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in which he expressed his intention of appearing at Constance,
and invited all who had any complaint to make
against him to appear in support of it.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The charges against Huss may be reduced to two
heads (unless indeed they should rather be considered as
one): that he was a follower of Wiclif, and that he was
infected with the “leprosy of the Vaudois.” The opinions
contained under the latter charge are thus enumerated
(with the exception of a few particulars), from
Æneas Sylvius,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> by Mr. Waddington; it being premised
that, of those thus imputed to him, Huss expressly disavowed
many. “The most important of them were
these:—that the Pope is on a level with other bishops;
that all priests are equal, except in regard to personal
merit; that souls, on quitting their bodies, are immediately
condemned to eternal punishment, or exalted to
everlasting happiness; that the fire of purgatory has no
existence; that prayers for the dead are a vain device,
the invention of sacerdotal avarice; that the images of
God and the saints should be destroyed; that the orders
of mendicants were invented by evil spirits; that the
clergy ought to be poor, subsisting on eleemosynary contributions;
that it is free to all men to preach the word
of God; that any one guilty of mortal sin is thereby disqualified
for any dignity, secular or ecclesiastical; that
confirmation and extreme unction are not among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
holy rites of the church; that auricular confession is unprofitable,
since confession to God is sufficient for pardon;
that the use of cemeteries is without reasonable
foundation, and inculcated for the sake of profit; that
the world itself is the temple of the omnipotent God,
and that those only derogate from his majesty who build
churches, monasteries, or oratories; that the sacerdotal
vestments, the ornaments of the altars, the cups and other
sacred utensils, are of no more than vulgar estimation;
that the suffrages of the saints who reign with Christ in
heaven are unprofitable and vainly invoked; that there
is no holiday excepting Sunday; that the festivals of the
saints should by no means be observed; and that the
fasts established by the church are equally destitute of
divine authority.” Of these doctrines, whether truly or
falsely imputed to Huss, many were of a nature to excite
the anger of a corrupt and avaricious priesthood; and he
is said to have added another still more calculated to prejudice
the minds of his judges against him: he maintained
that tithes were strictly eleemosynary, and that
it was free for the owner of the land to withhold or pay
them according to the measure of his charity. He also
maintained the right of the laity to participate in the
sacramental cup. It appears from a short treatise, written
in the year 1413, and exposed to public view at the
chapel of Bethlehem, entitled ‘Six Errors,’ that he denied
to the priesthood the power of granting remission of
punishment and absolution from sin; that he condemned
the doctrine, that obedience is due to a superior in all
things; that he maintained that an unjust excommunication
was not binding on the person against whom it was
levelled; and that he condemned as heretical the simoniacal
offences against canon law, of which he accused a
large portion of the clergy. He also in his sermons condemned
as useless prayers for the souls of the dead,
though it appears in the same sermon that he believed
in purgatory; and rebuked the avarice of the priests, by
whom the practice of exacting large presents, as the price
of ransoming souls from purgatory by their masses, had
been invented.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The readiness of Huss to face the Council is not to
be ascribed to ignorance of the risk which he was about
to incur. He addressed a letter to one of his friends,
with a request indorsed, that it might not be opened,
except in case of his death: it contained a species of
confession. He also wrote an exhortation to his Bohemian
congregation, in which he urges them to remain
constant in the doctrine which he had faithfully preached
to them; expresses his belief, that he should meet with
more enemies at the council than Christ had at Jerusalem;
prays for health and strength to maintain the truth
to the last, resolved to suffer any extremes, rather than
betray the Gospel from any cowardice; requests the
prayers of his friends in his behalf; and speaks very
doubtfully of his return, expressing his willingness to
die in God’s cause.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Yet if good faith were necessarily
inherent in high rank, he had no reason to fear. The
Emperor Sigismond gave him a safe conduct, pledging
himself, and enjoining his subjects, to facilitate and
secure the safe passage of Huss to and fro: and Pope
John XXIII. professed, “though John Huss should
murder my own brother, I would use the whole of my
power to preserve him from every injury, during all the
time of his residence at Constance.” He arrived in that
city in November, 1414. But the first proceedings of
the Council showed that anything rather than an impartial
hearing was intended. Huss was committed to
close custody, and denied the privilege of being heard
by an advocate, though he lay sick in prison; on the
ground that the canon law allowed no one to undertake
the defence of persons suspected of heresy. Meanwhile,
he was harassed with private interrogatories, and
denied a public audience before the assembled Council.
This right he demanded with urgency; and the interference
of the Emperor Sigismond, who seems to have
felt in this instance what was due to one who was placed
under his protection, procured it for him. Early in
June, 1415, the Council was convened, to hear the
charges against him, and his defence. The first charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
was read, and he began to reply: but when he appealed
to Scripture, as the authority on which his doctrines
were founded, his voice was overwhelmed with clamour.
He ceased: but when he again attempted to speak, the
clamour was renewed; and the assembly adjourned in
confusion to June 7, on which day the Emperor was
requested to preside in person. His presence secured
more decency of proceeding. The charges brought
against Huss were based chiefly on his supposed adherence
to the doctrines of Wiclif (concerning the truth of which
it was needless to dispute, since they had already been
condemned by the Council, May 4, 1415), and on his
opinion as to the administration of the Eucharist. The
arguments which he was permitted to adduce were received,
as before, with shouts of derision, and the assembly
adjourned to the following day. It happened,
and the coincidence was calculated to make a deep impression
on the minds of those who inclined to his
doctrines, that on that day an eclipse of the sun took
place, which was total at Prague, and nearly total at
Constance.</p>

<p>His audience was renewed on the following day. Of
the opinions imputed to him, he rejected some, and
admitted others; and those which he did admit, he defended
temperately and reasonably. The hearing being
closed, he was required by the Council to retract his
errors. It does not appear that any distinction was made
between those which he admitted and those which he
denied: the Council assumed, that he held certain
opinions, and he was called to recant them in the gross,
or to seal his adherence to them by martyrdom. His
reply bears testimony to the purity of his motives and
to the humility of his temper. “As to the opinions
imputed to me, which I have never held, those I cannot
retract; as to those which I do indeed profess, I am
ready to retract them, when I shall be better instructed
by the Council.” The Emperor, who had taken an
active part in persuading him to save himself by submission,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
now avowed his opinion, that “among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
errors of Huss, which had been in part proved, and in
part confessed, there was not one which did not deserve
the penal flames;” and “that the temporal sword ought
instantly to be drawn, for the chastisement of his disciples,
to the end that the branches of the tree might
perish, together with its root.” The Council was not
slow to inflict the penalty thus recommended. Huss
was remanded to prison: his constancy was severely
tried by a month’s imprisonment, in which every means
of persuasion and solicitation were used to induce him
to retract, and live. But he continued calm and resolved,
in a strain of mind equally removed from pride and
stubbornness, and from laxity and indifference, replying
to those who urged him to abjure his belief, that “he
was prepared to afford an example in himself of that
enduring patience which he had so frequently preached
to others, and which he relied on the grace of God to
grant him.” He retained this temper to the end; and
in this he may serve as a pattern or a rebuke to many
persons, who, though zealous for the truth, have shown
in the character of martyrs as much of bigotry and intolerance
as their persecutors; and this temper was
shown nowhere more beautifully than in one of his last
trials, “if indeed (we quote from Mr. Waddington) we
can so designate the upright counsel of a faithful and
virtuous friend, for such was the circumstance which
completed and crowned the history of his imprisonment;
and it should be everywhere recorded, for the honour of
human nature. A Bohemian nobleman, named John of
Chlum, had attended Huss, whose disciple he was,
through all his perils and persecutions, and had exerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
throughout the whole affair every method that he could
learn or devise to save him. At length, when every
hope was lost, and he was about to separate from the
martyr for the last time, he addressed him in these
terms: ‘My dear master, I am unlettered, and consequently
unfit to counsel one so enlightened as you.
Nevertheless, if you are secretly conscious of any one of
those errors which have been publicly imputed to you,
I do entreat you not to feel any shame in retracting it;
but if, on the contrary, you are convinced of your innocence,
I am so far from advising you to say anything
against your conscience, that I exhort you rather to
endure every form of torture, than to renounce anything
which you hold to be true.’ John Huss replied with
tears, that God was his witness, how ready he had ever
been, and still was, to retract on oath, and with his whole
heart, from the moment he should be convicted of any
error, by <i>evidence from the Holy Scripture</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> He confirmed
this assertion in a letter, written on the eve of
his execution, to the Senate of Prague, warning them
that he had retracted and abjured nothing, but was ready
to abjure and express his detestation of every proposition
extracted from his books which could be proved contrary
to Scripture.</p>

<p>Thus passed the month between his trial and his
execution, not in struggles to avoid, but in preparation
to meet his fate. “God,” he said, “in his wisdom, has
reasons for thus prolonging my life.” On the 15th of
July, he was brought before the Council for the last
time. He listened on his knees while his sentence was
read; and though it was endeavoured to prevent him
from speaking, he asserted from time to time the falsehood
of some of the charges brought against him. That
of obstinacy, for instance, he repelled hardily. “This,”
he said, “I deny boldly. I always have, and do still
desire to be better instructed by Scripture; and assert, that
I am so zealous for the truth, that if by one word I could
overthrow the errors of all heretics, there is no peril<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
which I would not face for that end.” Against the
condemnation of his books he protested, because hitherto
no errors had been shown to exist in them, and because,
being chiefly written in Bohemian, or translated into
languages understood by few of the members, the Council
could not read, nor understand, nor, by consequence,
legitimately condemn them. At the close of the sentence,
he called God to witness his innocence, and offered a
prayer that his judges and accusers might find pardon.
Nothing then remained but to proceed to his degradation;
and it may not be irrelevant to give a short account of
the forms used in this ceremony, childish as they may
appear. Certain bishops, appointed to perform this office,
caused Huss to be robed in his full sacerdotal vestments,
and a cup to be placed in his hand, as if he were
going to perform mass. As they put upon him a long
white robe, named the <i>aube</i>, he said, “Our Saviour was
clothed, in mockery, in a white robe, when sent by Herod
before Pilate:” and he made similar reflections as the
other ensigns of the sacred functions were successively
put upon him. Being thus dressed, the bishops again
exhorted him to recant; but turning to the people, he
declared in a loud voice, that he never would offend and
seduce the faithful by a declaration so full of hypocrisy
and impiety, and thus publicly protested his innocence.
Then the bishops took from him the chalice, reciting the
words, “O cursed Judas, who having forsaken the counsel
of peace, hast entered into that of the Jews, we take
away this cup, &amp;c.,” according to the common formula
for degrading a priest. On this, Huss said aloud, that
through the mercy of God, he hoped that day to drink
of that cup in his kingdom. The bishops then took
away his sacerdotal garments, one after the other, pronouncing
some malediction at the removal of each. When
they came to obliterate the tonsure, the mark of priesthood,
a ludicrous question arose, whether scissors or razors
should be used; and after a warm debate, it was decided
in favour of the former. His hair was closely cropped,
a pyramidal paper cap, an ell high, painted with figures
of devils, and inscribed “Heresiarch,” was put on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
head; and thus attired, the prelates charitably consigned
his soul to the infernal devils.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Divested thus of the
sacred character of priesthood, he was delivered over to
the secular power, represented by the Emperor, under
whose safe&ndash;conduct he had repaired to Constance, and
who had yet openly given his voice for causing the heretic
to expiate his errors by the torments of fire. The Emperor
charged the Elector Palatine with the duty of
seeing the penalties of the law inflicted: and it is said,
that a succeeding elector, the descendant in the fourth
generation of the person thus employed, who was a
favourer of the Reformation, and dying childless, witnessed
the extinction of his line, was wont to attribute
that misfortune to the anger of Heaven, punishing in the
fourth generation the bigoted and cruel eagerness with
which his ancestor had executed the unholy task intrusted
to him on this occasion.</p>

<p>Huss was immediately conducted to the stake, and
suffered his agonizing death with unshaken firmness. It
is told by an old writer of his life, that the people said,
hearing the fervency of his address to God, “We do
not know what this man has done before; but now, we
hear him offer up excellent prayers.” His ashes were
carefully collected and cast into the Rhine, lest they
should serve to keep up the affection of his friends: but
the precaution was vain, for we are told<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> that the very
earth of the spot on which he was burnt was collected
as a sacred relic, and carried into Bohemia by his disciples.</p>

<p>Before the fate of Huss was determined, the Council
had wreaked a tardy vengeance on his forerunner and
preceptor Wiclif, whose body was ordered “to be taken
from the ground, and thrown far away from the burial
of any church.” After the lapse of thirteen years, the
empty insult was most effectually executed, by disinterring
and burning the reformer’s body, and casting the
ashes into a neighbouring brook. The often quoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
words of Fuller on this occasion may be equally well
applied to the good man whose history has just been
related:—“The brook did convey his ashes into Avon;
Avon into Severn; Severn into the narrow seas; they
into the main ocean. And thus the ashes of Wiclif are
the emblem of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all
the world over.”</p>

<p>Jerome of Prague has been already mentioned as the
most distinguished among Huss’s followers, and his
coadjutor in preaching. He also was summoned to
Constance in the spring of 1415, before Huss had suffered
martyrdom; and it was probably in consequence
of witnessing his companion’s sufferings that he was induced
to retract, to condemn in the strongest terms, as
blasphemous and seditious, the tenets which in his heart
he still continued to hold, and to profess his entire adherence
to all the doctrines of the Roman church. Fortunately
he was not left to endure through life the
reproaches of conscience; for the continued enmity and
mistaken persecution of his adversaries conferred a
benefit on him which they were far from intending. He
was still retained in confinement, and harassed with fresh
charges, though his retractation had been ample and
complete: for there were many who thought that hostility
to the hierarchy could not be expiated except by
blood. At last he obtained a public audience before the
Council, on the 23rd of May, 1416; when he recalled
his former recantation, confessing that it had been
dictated only by the fear of a painful death. There is a
close coincidence between the history of Jerome, and
that of the father of our English church, Cranmer, who
suffered a similar death in the following century. Both
swerved through the influence of fear from the path of
duty: both were punished for their weakness by being
treacherously deprived of that temporal advantage which
was the price of their apostacy; and, being recalled by
that mistaken malice to their duty, both redeemed their
virtue, and have obtained eternal honour in exchange for
a short and shameful breathing&ndash;time on earth. Poggio
the Florentine, who was a witness of the whole course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of Jerome’s trial, has left a long and interesting account
of it in a letter to Leonardo Aretino, from which it
appears that his sympathy had been strongly excited by
the constancy of the sufferer. Though connected with
the highest dignitaries of the church, he writes in such a
strain of admiration, that his friend thought it necessary
to warn him of the danger which he might incur by
speaking of a condemned heretic in such terms. The
letter will be found entirely translated in Mr. Shepherd’s
Life of Poggio Bracciolini, from which the following
description of Jerome’s final sufferings is extracted:—“No
stoic ever suffered death with such constancy of
mind; when he arrived at the place of execution he
stripped himself of his garments, and knelt down before
the stake, to which he was soon after tied with ropes
and a chain. Then great pieces of wood, intermixed
with straw, where piled as high as his breast. When
fire was set to the pile, he began to sing a hymn, which
was scarcely interrupted by the smoke and flame. I
must not omit a striking circumstance, which shows the
firmness of his mind. When the executioner was going
to apply the fire behind him, in order that he might not
see it, he said, Come this way, and kindle it in my
sight; for if I had been afraid of it, I should never have
come to this place. Thus perished a man in every
respect exemplary, except in the erroneousness of his
faith. I was a witness of his end, and observed every
particular of its process. He may have been heretical
in his notions, and obstinate in persevering in them: but
he certainly died like a philosopher. I have rehearsed a
long story; as I wish to employ my leisure in relating
a transaction which far surpasses the events of ancient
history. For neither did Mutius suffer his hand to be
burnt so patiently as Jerome endured the burning of his
whole body; nor did Socrates drink the hemlock as
cheerfully as Jerome submitted to the fire.”</p>

<p>If it were really hoped to purge the dross of heresy
from Bohemia by this fiery ordeal, the result is another
lesson to prove the inutility of combating opinion by
violence. The nobility considered the breach of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Emperor’s safe&ndash;conduct as an insult to the kingdom of
Bohemia: the commons, prepared for rebellion against
the spiritual dominion of Rome, and inflamed by the
fate of their loved and venerated teachers, broke into
acts of violence. Fresh measures of provocation on each
side soon led to extremities; a crusade was proclaimed
against Bohemia by Pope Martin V., and headed by the
Emperor Sigismond; and the quarrel was thus fairly
committed to the arbitration of the sword. Enthusiasm
made up for the apparent inequality of force: the insurgents
assumed the name of Taborites, named the
mountain on which they pitched their tents Tabor, and
stigmatized their neighbours by the names of the idolatrous
nations from whom the Israelites won the Holy
Land. They often defeated the armies of the church,
and maintained their ground so firmly, that in 1433 the
Council of Basle endeavoured to invite their leaders to
a conference. This attempt at pacification failed; but
it taught the Catholics how to avail themselves of the
religious differences which distracted these enthusiastic
men: and in 1436, the church and the Emperor gained
the final ascendency, more by civil discord than by the
sword. But in the fifteenth century, a numerous party
in Bohemia preserved the faith for which Huss and
Jerome had suffered, and their fathers had fought; and
received with joy the ampler reformation preached by
Luther.</p>

<p>The second subject which we have proposed to notice
belongs to a period of much interest in British history,
that of the fruitless attempt of Charles II. to re&ndash;impose
episcopacy upon the Scottish nation. Few spectacles
are more elevating and more improving than the patient
endurance of evil for conscience’ sake even in an individual;
and it is still more impressive, where a multitude
are actuated by common feelings and a common principle.
Such was the case with the persecuted body of the Scottish
Presbyterian recusants; and if there be any to whom
the questions, whether a written ritual or extemporaneous
prayer should be used, whether the Episcopal or Presbyterian
form of church government should prevail, appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
insufficient grounds of dispute to justify a civil war, it is
to be remembered that in this case the aggression was
entirely on the side of the government; that Charles II.
had more than once taken the Covenant, the mere refusal
to abjure which was now thought worthy of death; that
the rebels, if that name be applicable to them, sought
nothing more than liberty to serve God after their own
consciences; and further, that the arbitrary violence
which would have annulled the established church of
Scotland, to substitute another which the bulk of the
nation hated, was only one of that series of mistaken and
criminal measures which led to the expulsion of the House
of Stuart from the throne. Upwards of three hundred
ministers were driven from their livings in one day, to
derive a scanty maintenance from their poor but zealous
hearers: but these men neither offered resistance, nor
preached rebellion, until they were debarred from performing
their pastoral office. And even when they and
their followers did take arms, it was originally in self&ndash;defence,
to protect meetings for the peaceable purpose of
divine worship, held in the wildest recesses of the trackless
hills, from the fury of a most licentious soldiery,
which even that strict concealment could not mitigate or
elude. That the better cause was disgraced by some
extravagances and crimes, and that it gave rise in some to
a morose and gloomy spirit of fanaticism, will not surprise
any who have considered the effect of persecution,
which, the very converse of mercy, is twice cursed in its
operation, a curse on him who inflicts, as on him who
suffers. Driven to assemble in moss and mountain, girt
with their swords, and prepared to defend life and faith
by the strong hand, it is no wonder if these men turned
in preference to the warlike pages of the sacred records,
and in tone, and conduct, and phraseology imitated the
martial leaders and reformers of Judæa, rather than the
milder teachers of the religion which it was their boast to
hold fast in its utmost purity. Continually occupied by
the thought of death, engaged in a constant struggle to
subdue their natural fears and affections into the resolution
to serve the Lord after what they deemed the only true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
faith, and to abide in him to the uttermost, it is no wonder
that Cameron, Cargill, Peden, and other zealous preachers,
whose rude and stern eloquence roused the Scottish
peasant to the indurance of martyrdom, in many instances
lost sight of reason in enthusiasm, and in some, themselves
or their followers, committed acts which rendered
them justly amenable to legal punishment.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> It forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
however, no part of our subject to enter into a defence
of their conduct or doctrine. The lofty spirit of resignation
in which they met their fate is the only point in
their history which admits of comparison with the subject&ndash;matter
of this chapter: and in this respect, the
Athenian philosopher had no advantage over the humblest
of these unlettered peasants. The stories of their resignation,
nay of their exultation in the hour of trial, have
been preserved by tradition; and their scattered graves
in the wild moorlands of Southern Scotland are still
regarded with veneration and affection. May it be long
before a feeling dies away, so well calculated to keep
alive a hatred of oppression, and a strong sense of the
importance of religion!</p>

<p>There is extant a singular and affecting account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
death of one of these sufferers, written by Alexander
Peden, an enthusiastic preacher of the Cameronian sect,
which is rendered more striking by the rudeness of the
narrative, and the minute circumstantiality of the
details. This is one of the passages which we propose to
take from this portion of our history; the other consists
of some extracts relative to the sufferings and death of
one of the most accomplished and discreet, as well as
most pious, of the ministers who suffered during the persecution
under the two last kings of the Stuart family.
The former of these two, by name John Brown, was a
small farmer and carrier, resident at Priesthill, in the
parish of Muirkirk, an upland district on the borders of
Ayrshire and Lanarkshire; “a man” says Wodrow, “of
shining piety, who had great measures of solid digested
knowledge and experience, and a singular talent of a
most plain and affecting way of communicating his
knowledge to others.” This man was orderly, sedate,
and discreet, and nowise obnoxious to the ruling party,
except as a conscientious and inflexible seceder from the
Episcopalian worship attempted to be imposed. Our
tale is taken from a publication entitled the ‘Life of
Mr. Alexander Peden,’ published about the year 1720.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>“In the beginning of May, 1685, he (Mr. Alexander
Peden) came to the house of John Brown and Marion
Weir, whom he married before he went to Ireland, where
he staid all night, and in the morning, when he took
farewell, he came out of the door, saying to himself,
‘Poor woman, a fearful morning,’ twice over; ‘A dark
misty morning.’ The next morning, between five and
six hours, the said John Brown having performed the
worship of God in his family, was going with a spade in
his hand to make ready some peat ground: the mist
being very dark, he knew not until cruel and bloody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Claverhouse compassed him with three troops of horse,
brought him to his house, and then examined him; who,
though he was a man of a stammering speech, yet
answered him distinctly and solidly; which made Claverhouse
to examine those whom he had taken to be his
guide through the muirs, if ever they heard him preach.
They answered, No, no; he was never a preacher. He
said, ‘If he has not preached, mickle has he prayed in
his time.’ He said to John, ‘Go to your prayers, for
you shall immediately die.’ When he was praying,
Claverhouse interrupted him three times: one time that
he stopt him, he was pleading that the Lord would spare
a remnant, and not make a full end in the day of his
anger. Claverhouse said, ‘I gave you time to pray, and
ye are begun to preach:’ he turned about upon his
knees and said, ‘Sir, you know neither the nature of
preaching or praying, that calls this preaching.’ Then
continued without confusion; when ended, Claverhouse
said, ‘Take good&ndash;night of your wife and children.’ His
wife standing by with her child in her arms that she had
brought forth to him, and another child of his first wife’s,
he came to her, and said, ‘Now Marion, the day is come,
that I told you would come when I first spake to you of
marrying me.’ She said, ‘Indeed, John, I can willingly
part with you.’ ‘Then,’ he said, ‘this is all I desire, I
have no more to do but to die.’ He kissed his wife and
bairns, and wished purchased and promised blessings to
be multiplied upon them, and his blessing. Claverhouse
ordered six soldiers to shoot him:<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> the most part of the
bullets came upon his head, which scattered his brains on
the ground. Claverhouse said to his wife, ‘What thinkest
thou of thy husband now, woman?’ She said, ‘I thought
ever much of him, and now as much as ever.’ He said,
‘It were justice to lay thee beside him.’ She said, ‘If
ye were permitted, I doubt not but that your crueltie
would go that length; but how will ye make answer for
this morning’s work?’ He said, ‘To man I can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
answerable; and for God, I will take him in my own
hand.’ Claverhouse mounted his horse, and marched,
and left her with the corpse of her dead husband lying
there; she set the bairn upon the ground, and gathered
his brains, and tied up his head, and straighted his body,
and covered him in her plaid, and sat down and wept
over him. It being a very desolate place, where never
verdure grew, and far from neighbours, it was some time
before any friends came to her; the first that came was
a very fit hand, that old singular Christian woman in the
Cummerhead, named Elizabeth Menzies, three miles
distant, who had been tried with the violent death of her
husband at Pentland, afterwards of two worthy sons,
Thomas Weir, who was killed at Drumclog, and David
Steel, who was suddenly shot afterwards when taken.
The said Marion Weir sitting upon her husband’s grave,
told me, that before that, she could see no blood but what
she was in danger to faint; and yet she was helped to be
a witness to all this, without either fainting or confusion,
except when the shots were let off, her eyes dazzled.
His corpse was buried at the end of his house, where he
was slain, with this inscription on his grave&ndash;stone:—</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">In earth’s cold bed, the dusty part here lies<br />
Of one who did the earth as dust despise!<br />
Here in this place, from earth he took departure;—<br />
Now he has got the garland of the martyr.</p>

<p class="pn1">This murder was committed between six and seven in the
morning: Mr. Peden was about ten or eleven miles
distant, having been in the fields all night; he came to
the house between seven and eight, and desired to call
in the family, that he might pray amongst them. When
praying, he said, ‘Lord, when wilt thou avenge Brown’s
blood? Oh! let Brown’s blood be precious in thy sight!
and hasten the day when thou wilt avenge it, with
Cameron’s, Cargill’s, and many others of our martyrs’
names; and oh! for that day, when the Lord would
avenge all their bloods.’</p>

<p>“When ended, John Muirhead inquired what he
meant by Brown’s blood? He said twice over, ‘What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
do I mean? Claverhouse has been at the Priesthill this
morning, and has cruelly murdered John Brown: his
corpse was lying at the end of his house, and his poor
wife sitting weeping by his corpse, and not a soul to speak
a word comfortably to her.’”</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that this atrocity was single or
singular in its nature, or that it and others rest upon doubtful
testimony. “No historical facts,” says Mr. Fox, “are
better ascertained than the account of these instances of
cruelty which are to be found in Wodrow.” And the
extent to which they were carried may be appreciated
from the number of military executions or murders recorded
by that author,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> in the two first months only of
the year in which the above tragedy was enacted.
Neither must it be supposed that these were the unwarranted
excesses of a brutal soldiery: the Privy Council,
the chief executive power of Scotland, clearly pointed out
the line of conduct to be pursued in its instructions;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and in its dealings with the prisoners brought before it,
showed equally clearly that the exceeding of their orders
in severity would not be harshly construed. There are
few who do not recollect the scene in ‘Old Mortality,’
in which the preacher Macbriar is examined before the
Council: and the fiction does go one step beyond the
reality, as detailed in the authentic pages of Wodrow.
Those who did not perish by shot or sword, had often
reason to wish that their sufferings had been ended by
the summary method of military execution. Torture
was pitilessly used to extract confession; and branding,
banishment, and hanging, were largely employed, not
only against the violent spirits whom persecution had driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to assume arms, but against those who offered none but
passive resistance. And this severity was the cause, not
the consequence, of the more violent sects rising in arms:
it was the result of a premeditated scheme to oppress,
if not to root out, Presbyterianism, as tending to keep
alive a spirit of independence, civil as well as religious.
With this intention, the ministers and other prominent
persons were first attacked under form of law: it was
not until their firmness proved to be inexpugnable, that
the act of assembling for worship was itself proscribed.
Even so early as 1661, Mr. James Guthrie, one of the
most eminent ministers of the Scottish church, a man of
moderation and discretion, as well as zeal, learning, and
piety, was singled out as a victim. Hume’s account of
this transaction is a good specimen of the spirit in which
he treats of this period of history. “It was deemed
political to hold over men’s heads for some time the
terror of punishment, till they should have made the
requisite compliances with the new government. Though
neither the king’s temper nor plan of administration led
him to severity, some examples, after such a bloody and
triumphant rebellion, seemed necessary; and the Marquis
of Argyle and one Guthrie were pitched upon as
the victims.... Guthrie was a seditious preacher, and
had personally affronted the king: his punishment gave
surprise to nobody.” On this passage, we have to observe,
that Guthrie was not a person unknown or insignificant,
to be spoken of thus contemptuously (<i>one
Guthrie</i>); and in denial the latter statements, to quote
the following extract from Wodrow, whose testimony
we do not hesitate to prefer to that of Hume, neither
quoting their authority. “The king himself was so
sensible of his (Guthrie’s) good services to him and his
interest when at the lowest, and of the severity of this
sentence, that when he got notice of it, he asked with
some warmth, ‘And what have you done with Mr.
Patrick Gillespie?’ It was answered that Mr. Gillespie
had so many friends in the house, his life could
not be taken. ‘Well,’ said the king, ‘if I had known
you would have spared Mr. Gillespie, I would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
spared Mr. Guthrie.’<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> And indeed there was reason
for it, as to one who had been so firm and zealous a
supporter of his Majesties title and interest, and had
suffered so much for his continued opposition to, and
disowning of the English usurpation.” And far from
being an insignificant person, whose death might be
passed over as a matter of no account, the greatest pains
were taken to induce him to save his life by<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> making
concessions, with the value of which, as coming from
him, the court party were well acquainted. But his offence
and the reason for pursuing him to death are not obscurely
hinted at in the first sentence of our extract from
Hume: he had stood up against invasion of the rights
of the Presbyterian kirk, which the king, in swearing to
the Covenant, had bound himself to uphold; and therefore
he was made an example, “to hold over men’s
heads the terror of punishment, till they should have
made the requisite compliances with the new government.”
The charge against him was treason and sedition,
founded principally on the language of a petition
adopted by a meeting of ministers, August 23, 1660, of
which he was one, and on two publications, the ‘Western
Remonstrance,’ and ‘Causes of God’s Wrath,’ in
the sentiments of both of which he expressed his concurrence
on his trial: and in his last speech he acknowledged
himself the author of the latter. From one of
his speeches before the parliament, we extract the following
passage, which is worth the attention of those
who think that opinions are to be stifled by violence.</p>

<p>“My lord, my conscience I cannot submit, but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
old crazy body, and mortal flesh I do submit, to do with
it whatsoever you will, whether by death, or banishment,
or imprisonment, or anything else; only I beseech you
to ponder well what profit there is in my blood: it is not
the extinguishing of me or many others that will extinguish
the Covenant and work of reformation since the
year 1638. My blood, bondage, or banishment will
contribute more for the propagation of those things than
my life or liberty could do, though I should live many
years.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>His death, however, was resolved on; and in spite of
the vigour of his defence, and the laxness of the charges
against him, on which no lawyer since the Revolution
would have dared to build a charge of constructive
treason, he was found guilty and sentenced to be
hanged; which sentence was carried into effect June
1, 1661. He commenced his dying speech in these
words:—</p>

<p>“Men and brethren, I fear many of you are come
hither to gaze, rather than to be edified by the carriage
and last words of a dying man; but if any have an ear to
hear, as I hope some of this great confluence have, I
desire your audience to a few words. I am come hither
to lay down this earthly tabernacle and mortal flesh of
mine, and, I bless God, through his grace, I do it willingly,
and not by constraint. I say, I suffer willingly:
if I had been so minded, I might have made a division,
and not been a prisoner; but being conscious to myself
of nothing worthy of death or bonds, I could not stain
my innocency with the suspicion of guiltiness, by my
withdrawing; neither have I wanted opportunities and
advantages to escape since I was prisoner,—not by the
fault of my keepers, God knoweth, but otherwise; but
neither for this had I light or liberty, lest I should reflect
upon the Lord’s name, and offend the generation of the
righteous: and if some men have not been mistaken, or
dealt deceitfully in telling me so, I might have avoided
not only the severity of the sentence, but also had much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
favour and countenance in complying with the courses
of the times. But I durst not redeem my life with the
loss of my integrity, God knoweth I durst not; and that
since I was prisoner, he hath so holden me by the hand,
that he never suffered me to bring it in debate in my inward
thoughts, much less to propose or hearken to any
overture of that kind. I did judge it better to suffer
than to sin; and therefore I am come hither to lay down
my life this day.”</p>

<p>He proceeded to justify his own loyalty, and the conduct
for which he was condemned, as in no way treasonable
or seditious, but a conscientious upholding of the
rights and privileges of the church: and bearing testimony
to the sacredness of the Covenant, and to his own adherence
to it, and to the doctrine and discipline of the
Presbyterian church, he concluded in an exalted strain of
piety and thankfulness, and met his death, according to
the testimony of Burnet, above quoted, with the utmost
tranquillity.</p>

<p>“It was very confidently asserted at this time, that
some weeks after Mr. Guthrie’s head had been set up on
the Netherbow Port in Edinburgh, the commissioner’s
coach coming down that way, several drops of blood fell
from the head upon the coach, which all their art and
diligence could not wipe off. I have it very confidently
affirmed, that physicians were called, and inquired if any
natural cause could be assigned for the blood dropping
so long after the head was put up, and especially for it
not washing out of the leather; and they could give none.
This odd incident beginning to be talked of, and all other
methods being tried, at length the leather was removed,
and a new cover put on: this was much sooner done than
the wiping off the guilt of this great and good man’s
blood from the shedders of it, and this poor nation. The
above report I shall say no more of; it was generally
spoken of at the time, and is yet firmly believed by many:
at this distance I cannot fully vouch it as certain; perhaps
it may be thought too miraculous for the age we
are now in: but this I will affirm, that Mr. Guthrie’s
blood was of so crying a nature, that even Sir George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Mackenzie was sensible that all his rhetoric, though he
was a great master in that sort, had not been sufficient
to drown it, for which cause he very wisely passed it
over in silence.”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>This is rather a remarkable instance of a common
superstition. The reader who will consult the original
authorities, will be struck by the elevated tone of joyful
anticipation with which the sufferers of this period almost
uniformly met death. See the accounts of King, Mackail,
Renwick, and many others. Compare these deaths
with those of Socrates or Cato, and we have the best
exemplification of the practical difference between Christianity
and Heathenism, even in its purest forms. “The
Heathen looked on death without fear, the Christian
exulted.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The English reader will naturally look in a chapter
devoted to the subjects by which this is occupied, for
some account of the persecution of the reformed church
of his own country in the reign of Mary. This is a
period very different in character from that persecution
of the Scottish Presbyterians, which we have just described,
but not inferior in interest. Their stubborn
opposition for conscience’ sake is well contrasted by
the mild submission of the English reformers for conscience’
sake also; as the ascetic lives, and in many cases
the stern and gloomy tenets of the former are contrasted
with the innocent and decent cheerfulness, and
more attractive doctrines encouraged, practised, and
preached, by the latter. These differences may be
explained by various causes, arising from a difference of
national character and natural circumstances. The
Scotch have always been a people not lightly moved,
but stern in temper, and stubborn in endurance when
roused into action: and their wild country and defensible
fastnesses rendered it easy, in the first instance, to withdraw
from vexatious interference, in the second, when
pursued, to oppose violence successfully. And besides,
the resolute resistance of the Cameronians and others
was the fruit of a spirit of independence of long growth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
fostered by long contests with the crown, both in
England and Scotland; and the civil wars had effectually
broken down the notion, that it was forbidden to take up
arms, even for conscience’ sake, against the powers that
be. That their conduct, if not always judicious, was in
its main principles worthy of honour and admiration, we
have already stated to be our opinion: but we are not on
that account less ready to admire the calm submission of
the English reformers, coupled with their resolute upholding
of the truth. The Scottish zealots had studied
the Old Testament till they had imbibed rather too
much of the Jewish temper: the conduct of the fathers
of our church was full of the very spirit of Christianity.
The latter were not more distinguished than the former
for uprightness of life, devotion to the truth, as they
received it, or readiness to seal their adherence to it by
death. But they had the advantage in depth of learning,
in a more temperate gravity of conduct, and soundness
of judgment: and it is on these accounts, as well as by
reason of the more eminent station which they filled in
the eyes of the world, that they have always been reverenced
as shining lights; while the persecuted sects of
Scotland were long regarded by those who were but
generally acquainted with that period of our history,
either with hatred or contempt in proportion as the cruel
extravagances of a few, or the so&ndash;called moroseness, and
puritanical precision of the many, made most impression.</p>

<p>The stories of Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley, and
others high in rank, are familiarly known even to
children, in whose limited circle of historical reading
the horrors of this period have been suffered to hold too
prominent a place. Less known to fame, yet not
inferior to any, it should seem, in the qualities of the
heart and the understanding, was he whose memorable
death we have selected for narration; and in whose
rustic simplicity of deportment, and somewhat coarse
jocularity, and grotesque contour of person (a circumstance
which is to be inferred from various parts of the
narrative), we trace a resemblance, slight, and unimportant,
yet not uninteresting, to the Athenian philosopher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
as well as in his care, retained to the last, for the
feelings and welfare of his friends, and his resolute refusal
to compromise the goodness of his cause by flight.</p>

<p>“Of Rowland Taylor (says Bishop Heber) neither
the name nor the misfortunes are obscure. He was
distinguished among the divines of the Reformation
for his abilities, his learning, and piety; and he suffered
death at the stake on Aldham Common, near
Hadleigh, in the third year of Queen Mary, amid the
blessings and lamentations of his parishioners, and
with a courageous and kindly cheerfulness which has
scarcely its parallel, even in those days of religious
heroism.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing indeed more beautiful, in the whole
beautiful Book of Martyrs, than the account which Fox
has given of Rowland Taylor, whether in the discharge
of his duty as a parish priest, or in the more arduous
moments when he was called on to bear his cross in the
cause of religion. His warmth of heart, his simplicity
of manners, the total absence of the false stimulants of
enthusiasm or pride, and the abundant overflow of better
and holier feelings, are delineated, no less than his courage
in death, and the buoyant cheerfulness with which
he encountered it, with a spirit only inferior to the eloquence
and dignity of the Phædon. Something, indeed,
must be allowed for the manners of the age, before we
can be reconciled to the coarse vigour of his pleasantry,
his jocose menace to Bonner, and his jests with the
Sheriff on his own stature and corpulency. But nothing
can be more delightfully told than his refusal to fly from
the Lord Chancellor’s officers; his dignified yet modest
determination to await death in the discharge of his duty;
and his affectionate and courageous parting with his wife
and children. His recollection, when led to the stake,
of ‘the blind man and woman,’ his pensioners, is of the
same delightful character; nor has Plato anything more
touching than the lamentation of his parishioners over
his dishonoured head and long white beard, and his own
meek rebuke to the wretch who drew blood from that
venerable countenance. Let not my readers blame me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
for this digression. They will have cause to thank me,
if it induces them to refer to a history which few men
have ever read without its making them ‘sadder and
better.’”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Rowland Taylor, “a right perfect divine,” and parish
priest, according to the manners of the time, was chaplain
to Archbishop Cranmer; but on being appointed
rector of Hadleigh, a small town in Suffolk, he quitted
his patron’s family, to devote himself entirely to the
care of his living; and by his diligent study, and preaching,
and attention to the temporal as well as spiritual
welfare of his people, he both recommended the doctrines
which he taught, and acquired the esteem and
love of his parishioners in an uncommon degree. Such
was his occupation and character during the reign of
Edward VI.: on the accession of Mary, he was one of
the first to suffer for his adherence to the church and to
the laws, in consequence of his resistance to the attempts
made to reinstate Popish priests and Popish ceremonies
in the parochial churches. In this scheme to reconcile
England to the Pope, the renegade Gardiner, Bishop of
Winchester, and the brutal and ferocious Bonner, Bishop
of London, who figure prominently in the following
narrative, were the most zealous actors. The length
and prolix style of the original forbids us to extract the
entire story from the Book of Martyrs; but we shall
adhere to it as closely as we can, as well for the sake of
giving (according to the principle laid down in our introduction)
a specimen of the style of that remarkable
work, as for the characteristic touches and intrinsic
beauty of a great part of the narration. It begins with
an account of Taylor’s character and parochial labours
up to the death of Edward VI., and the subsequent
attempts of his sister and successor Mary, to restore, by
violence, the supremacy of the Roman Catholic religion.</p>

<p>“In the beginning of this rage of Antichrist (1553),
a certain petie gentleman, after the sort of a lawyer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
called Foster, a bitter persecutor in those days, with one
John Clerk, of Hadley, conspired to bring in the Pope
and his maumetrie<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> again into Hadley Church. To
this purpose they builded up with all haste possible
the altar, intending to bring in their masse againe,
about the Palme Sunday. But this their device took
none effect; for in the night the altar was beaten down;
wherefore they built it up againe the second time, and
laid diligent watch, lest any should againe break it down.</p>

<p>“On the day following came Foster and John Clerk,
bringing with them their Popish sacrificer, who brought
with him all his implements and garments to play his
Popish pageant, whom they and their men guarded with
swords and bucklers, lest any man should disturbe him
in his missall sacrifice.</p>

<p>“When Dr. Taylor, who (according to his custome)
sat at his booke studying the word of God, heard the
bels ring, hee arose, and went into the church, supposing
something had been there to be done, according to his
pastorall office: and coming to the church, he found the
church doores shut, and fast barred, saving the chancel
doore, which was only latched, where he entering, and
comming into the chancell, saw a Popish sacrificer in his
robes, with a broad new shaven crown, ready to begin
his Popish sacrifice, beset about with drawn swords and
bucklers, lest any man should approach to disturbe him.</p>

<p>“Then said Dr. Taylor, ‘Thou divell, who made
thee so bold to enter into this church of Christ, to prophane
and defile it with this abominable idolatry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>?’
With that start up Foster, and, with an ireful and
furious countenance, said to Dr. Taylor, ‘Thou traitor,
what doest thou here, to let and disturb the Queene’s
proceedings?’ Dr. Taylor answered, ‘I am no traitor,
but I am the shepherd that God, my Lord Christ, hath
appointed to feed this his flock; wherefore I have good
authority to bee here, and I command thee, thou Popish
wolf, in the name of God, to avoid hence, and not to
presume here with such Popish idolatry to poison Christ’s
flock.’”</p>

<p>Taylor being violently put out of the church, the
mass was continued. But he was a man to be feared for
his integrity, courage, and ability, and therefore to be
destroyed: and in those times, the transaction which we
have just related furnished means of proceeding against
him under colour of law. In a few days, upon complaint
of Clerk and Foster, he was cited to appear before Gardiner,
Bishop of Winchester, and Lord Chancellor.
“When his friends heard this, they earnestly counselled
him to depart and flye; alledging and declaring unto
him, that he could neither be indifferently heard to speak
his conscience and mind, nor yet look for justice or
favour at the said Chancellor’s hands, who, as it was
well knowne, was most fierce and cruell; but must needs
(if he went up to him) wait for imprisonment and cruell
death at his hands.”</p>

<p>“Then said Dr. Taylor to his friends, ‘Dear friends,
I most heartily thank you that you have so tender a care
over mee; and although I know that there is neither
justice nor truth to be looked for at my adversaries’
hands, but rather imprisonment and cruell death, yet
I know my cause to be so good and righteous, and the
truth so strong on my side, that I will, by God’s grace,
go and appear before them, and to their beards resist
their false doings.’”</p>

<p>In this mind, though strongly urged to fly, he continued,
and took his journey to London on horseback,
with a trusty servant named John Hull, who on the way
“laboured to counsel and perswade him very earnestly
to fly, and not to come to the Bishop; and proffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
himselfe to go with him to save him, and in all perils to
venture his life for him and with him. But in no wise
would Dr. Taylor consent or agree thereunto. Thus
they came up to London, and shortly after, Taylor presented
himself before the Bishop of Winchester.”</p>

<p>The account of this conference is amusing as well
as interesting, but it is both too long and too theological
to extract. Taylor, however, according to the
reporter, had altogether the best of it, except in the
conclusion, which was effected by what Fox, in his
marginal note, quaintly calls “Winchester’s strong argument,
Carry him to prison.” He remained in the
King’s Bench about a year and three&ndash;quarters, “in the
which time the Papists got certain old tyrannous lawes,
which were put down by King Henry VIII. and by
King Edward, to be revived again by Parliament, so
that now they might, <i>ex officio</i>, cite whom they would
upon their own suspicion, and charge him with what
articles they lusted, and, except they in all things
agreed to their purpose, burne them. When these laws
were once established, they sent for Dr. Taylor, with
certain other prisoners, which were againe convened
before the Chancellor, and other Commissioners, about
the 22d of January, 1555. The purport and effect of
which talke between them, because it is sufficiently
described by himselfe in his owne letter, written to a
friend of his, I have annexed the said letter here under,
as followeth<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>.... After that Dr. Taylor thus, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
great spirit and courage, had answered for himselfe, and
stoutly rebuked his adversaries for breaking their oath
made before to King Henry, and to King Edward his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
sonne, and for betraying the realme into the power of
the Roman Bishop; they, perceiving that in no case
could he be stirred to their wills and purpose, committed
him thereupon to prison againe, where he endured till
the last of January.”</p>

<p>On that day he was again brought before Winchester
and other bishops, and condemned to death. Being a
priest, however, he was to be degraded before he was
delivered to the civil power, and Bonner was appointed
to perform that office. “Well,” quoth the Bishop,
“I am come to degrade you; wherefore put on these
vestures.”<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> “No,” quoth Dr. Taylor, “I will not.”
“Wilt thou not?” said the Bishop. “I shall make
thee, ere I go.” Quoth Dr. Taylor, “You shall not,
by the grace of God.” Then he charged him upon his
obedience to do it; but he would not do it for him.</p>

<p>“So he willed another to put them on his backe;
and when he was thoroughly furnished therewith, he set
his hands to his side, walking up and down, and said,
‘How say you, my Lord, am I not a goodly foole?
How say you, my Masters? If I were in Cheape,
should I not have boyes enow to laugh at these apish
toyes and toying trumpery?’ So the Bishop scraped
his fingers, thumbes, and the crowne of his head, and did
the rest of such like divellish observances.</p>

<p>“At the last, when he should have given Dr. Taylor
a stroke on the breast with his crosier&ndash;staffe, the Bishop’s
Chaplain said, ‘My Lord, strike him not, for he will
sure strike againe.’ ‘Yea, by St. Peter, will I,’ quoth
Dr. Taylor, ‘the cause is Christ’s, and I were no
good Christian if I would not fight in my Master’s
quarrell.’ So the Bishop laid his curse on him, but
struck him not.... And when hee came up, he told
Master Bradford (for then both lay in one chamber) that
he had made the Bishop of London afraid: ‘for,’ saith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
he laughingly, ‘his Chaplain gave him counsell not to
strike me with his crosier&ndash;staffe, for that I would strike
againe; and, by my troth,’ said he, rubbing his hands, ‘I
made him believe I would doe so indeed.’”</p>

<p>After this ceremony he was delivered to the secular
power. His last interview with his family is thus simply
told. “Now when the Sheriffe and his company came
against St. Botolph church (in Aldgate), Elizabeth cried,
saying, ‘O my deare Father! Mother, Mother, here
is my father led away.’ Then cried his wife, ‘Rowland,
Rowland, where art thou?’ for it was a verie darke morning,
that the one could not see the other. Dr. Taylor
answered, ‘Deare wife, I am here,’ and staid. The
Sheriffe’s men would have led him forth, but the Sheriffe
said, ‘Stay a little, maisters, I praie you, and let him
speake to his wife;’ and so they staied.</p>

<p>“Then came she to him; and he tooke his daughter
Mary in his armes, and he, his wife, and Elizabeth,
kneeled down and said the Lord’s Praier: at which
sight the Sheriffe wept apace, and so did divers other of
the company. After they had praied, he rose up and
kissed his wife, and shooke her by the hand, and said,
‘Farewell, my deare wife, bee of good comfort, for I am
quiet in my conscience. God shall stir up a father for
my children.’ And then he kissed his daughter Mary,
and said, ‘God blesse thee, and make thee his servant:’
and kissing Elizabeth, hee said, ‘God blesse thee, I praie
you all stand strong and stedfast unto Christ and his
worde, and keep you from idolatry.’ Then said his
wife, ‘God be with thee, dear Rowland. I will with
God’s grace meet thee at Hadley.’</p>

<p>“And so he was led forth to the Woolsack.... And
at his comming out, John Hull before spoken of stood at
the railes with Dr. Taylor’s sonne. When Dr. Taylor
saw them, he called them, saying, ‘Come hither, my
sonne Thomas;’ and John Hull lifted up the child, and
set him on the horse before his father. Then lifted he
up his eyes toward heaven, and praied for his sonne,
laide his hatte on the child’s head, and blessed him, and
so delivered the child to John Hull, whom he tooke
by the hand, and said, ‘Farewell, John Hull, the faithfullest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
servant that ever man had.’ And so they rode
forth: the Sheriffe of Essex, with foure yeomen of the
guard, and the Sheriffe’s men leading him.”</p>

<p>He was thus conducted to Hadley, in the neighbourhood
of which was appointed the place of his execution,
at Aldham Moor. The even and cheerful tenour of his
mind is evinced in many points of our past narrative,
and confirmed by witnesses. “They that were present,
and familiarly conversant with this Dr. Taylor, reported
of him that they never did see in him any feare of death;
but especially and above all the rest, which besides him
suffered at the same time, always shewed himselfe merry
and cheerful in time of his imprisonment, as well before
his condemnation as after: he kept one countenance
and like behaviour. Whereunto he was rather confirmed
by the company and presence of Mr. John Bradford,
who then was in prison and chamber with him.
The same morning, when he was called up by the
Sheriffe to go to his burning, he cast his armes about a
balk which was in the chamber between Mr. Bradford’s
bed and his; and there hanging by the hands, said to
Mr. Bradford, ‘O, Mr. Bradford,’ said he, ‘what a
notable sway should I give if I were hanged,’ meaning
for that he was a corpulent and big man.” His unusual
stature seems to have been a favourite subject for jesting
with him; for we find a very elaborate piece of quizzing
on the same subject, approximating in character to that
species of wit which is sometimes denominated <i>trotting</i>.
It runs thus:—</p>

<p>“At Chelmsford, the Sheriff of Essex, being about to
deliver up his prisoner to the Sheriff of Suffolk, sought,
as they sat at supper, to induce him to recant. After
using the common topics, he concludes, ‘Ye should do
much better to revoke your opinions, and return to the
Catholike church of Rome: if ye will, doubt ye not but
ye shall find favour at the Queene’s hands. This councell
I give you, good Mr. Doctor, of a good heart, and good
will toward you; and thereupon I drink to you. In like
manner said all the Yeomen of the Guard. Upon that
condition, Mr. Doctor, we will all drink to you.’</p>

<p>“When they had all drunk to him, and the cup was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
come to him, he stayed a little, as one studying what
answer he might give. At the last thus he answered,
and said, ‘Master Sheriffe, and my masters all, I
heartily thank you for your good will; I have hearkened
to your words, and marked well your counsels;
and, to be plain with you, I do perceive that I have
been deceived myself, and am likely to deceive a great
many of Hadley of their expectation.’ With that word
they all rejoiced. ‘Yea, good Master Doctor,’ quoth
the Sheriffe, ‘God’s blessing on your heart, hold you
there still. It is the comfortablest word that we heard
you speak yet. What, should ye cast yourself away in
vaine: play a wise man’s part, and I dare warrant it, ye
shall finde favour.’ Thus they rejoiced very much at
the word, and were very merry.</p>

<p>“At the last, ‘Good Master Doctor,’ quoth the Sheriffe,
‘what meane ye by this, that ye said ye think ye
have been deceived yourselfe, and think ye shall deceive
many one in Hadley?’ ‘Would ye know my meaning
plainly?’ quoth he. ‘Yea,’ quoth the Sheriffe, ‘good
Master Doctor, tell it us plainly.’</p>

<p>“‘Then,’ said Dr. Taylor, ‘I will tell you how I
have been deceived, and, as I think, I shall deceive a
great many more: I am, as you see, a man that has a
very great carkasse, which I thought should have been
buried in Hadley church&ndash;yard, if I had died in my bed,
as I well hoped I should have done; but herein I see I
was deceived: and there are a great number of wormes
in Hadley church&ndash;yard, which should have had jolly
feeding on this carrion; which they have looked for
many a day. But now I know we be deceived, both I
and they; for this carkasse must be burnt to ashes, and
so shall they lose their bait and feeding, that they
looked to have had of it.’</p>

<p>“When the Sheriffe and his company heard him say
so, they were amazed, and looked one on another,
marvelling at the man’s constant minde, that thus
without all feare made a jest of the cruell torment, and
death now at hand prepared for him. Thus was their
expectation clean disappointed. And in this appeareth
what was his meditation in his chiefest wealth and prosperity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
namely, that he should shortly die, and feed
wormes in his grave; which meditation, if all our Bishops
and spirituall men had used, they had not, for a
little worldly glory, forsaken the word of God and truth
which they in King Edward’s days had preached and set
forth, nor yet to maintain the Bishop of Rome’s authority,
have committed to the fire so many as they did.”</p>

<p>“At Lavenham, a small town near Bury, where the
cavalcade remained two days, the attempts to induce
him to recant were renewed by the Sheriffe and gentlemen
of the county, of whom there was a great concourse,
with the promise even of promotion to a bishopric.
On the 8th of February he was brought out to
complete his earthly journey. The same spirit animated
him to the end. On the way, being alighted from his
horse, ‘he lept, and fet a friske or twaine,’ as men commonly
do in dauncing. ‘Why, Master Doctor,’ quoth
the Sheriffe, ‘how do you now?’ He answered,
‘Well, God be praised, good Master Sheriffe, never
better; for now I know I am almost at home. I lack
not past two stiles to go over, and I am even at my father’s
house; but Master Sheriffe,’ said he, ‘shall we not go
thorow Hadley?’ ‘Yes,’ quoth the Sheriffe, ‘you shall
go thorow Hadley.’ ‘Then,’ said he, ‘O good Lord, I
thank thee, I shall yet once again ere I die, see my
flock, whom thou, Lord, knowest I have most heartily
loved, and truely taught.’</p>

<p>“This wish being gratified, his last hours were soothed
by the accents which of all must have been most grateful,
the prayers and blessings of the poor, to whom he
had been as a father in the relieving of their corporeal
wants. The street of Hadley was lined with those who
invoked succour and strength for him, mingled with exclamations
of woe at the grievous loss which had befallen
themselves. Nor in his own extremity did he forget
the humblest and most needy of those who had been
objects of his care: but stopping by the alms&ndash;houses
he cast out of a glove to the inmates of them such money
as remained of what charitable persons had given for his
support in prison (his benefices being sequestrated): and
missing two of them, he asked, ‘Is the blind man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
blind woman that dwelt here alive?’ He was answered,
‘Yea, they are there within.’ Then threw he glove and
all in at the window, and so rode forth. Thus this good
father and provider for the poore took his leave of those
for whom all his life he had a singular care and
studie.</p>

<p>“At the last, coming to Aldham Common, the place
assigned where he should suffer, and seeing a great
multitude of people gathered together, he asked, ‘What
place is this; and what meaneth it that so much people
are gathered hither?’ It was answered, ‘It is Aldham
Common, the place where you must suffer; and the
people are come to looke upon you.’ ‘Then,’ said he,
‘thanked be God, I am even at home; and so light from
his horse, and with both his hands rent the hood from
his head.</p>

<p>“Now was his head notted evil favourably, and clipped
much like as a man would clip a foole’s head, which
cost the good Bishop Bonner had bestowed upon him when
he degraded him. But when the people saw his reverend
and ancient face with a long white beard, they burst
out with weeping teares, and cried saying, ‘God save
thee, good Doctor Taylor!’ with such other like godly
wishes. Then would he have spoken to the people, but
the yeomen of the guard were so busie about him, that as
soon as he opened his mouth, one or other thrust a
tippestaff into his mouth, and would in nowise permit
him to speak.</p>

<p>“As they were piling the faggots, one Warwick cruelly
cast a faggot at him, which light on his head and
broke his face, that the bloud ran down his visage.
Then said Dr. Taylor, ‘O friend, I have harme
enough; what needed that?’”</p>

<p>Here we take leave of him; for it is needless again
to enter into the revolting details of the barbarous
method of execution especially prescribed for errors in
matters of faith. The affection borne towards him was
beautifully manifested in a poor woman, who knelt at
the stake to join in his prayers, and could not be driven
away by threats or fear. His last moments were like
his life, tranquil, fearless, and forgiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, for the present at all events, we close this work.
We have now traced the Grecian nation from the outset
of authentic history to the period of its utmost greatness
in arms, arts, and letters: and in doing so, according to
the plan laid down in our introduction, we hope to have
accumulated a mass of historical anecdotes, which, independent
of their intrinsic beauty or interest, may possess
a further value, as tending to throw some light one on
another. Like the close of the Persian war, the close
of the Peloponnesian war is a remarkable epoch: the
former marks the beginning of the greatness, the latter
the beginning of the decline of Greece. From thenceforward
the history of Greece becomes more complicated,
and our authorities less satisfactory; inasmuch as,
at the close of Xenophon’s Hellenics, we lose that series
of admirable contemporary writers who have hitherto
guided us; and the late compilers, such as Diodorus and
Plutarch, make no adequate amends for the loss. The
study, therefore, of the succeeding portion of history
becomes less agreeable and more difficult: at the same
time there is no want of remarkable incidents; for if the
annals of Athens and Sparta become less important,
the rise of Thebes to its short&ndash;lived power, the sudden
growth of Thessaly under Jason of Pheræ, of Macedonia
under Philip, and, above all, the renovation of the
old Grecian spirit in the Achæan league, would supply
abundance to fill another volume, which should bring
down the history of Greece to its final absorption into
the Roman empire.</p>

After the battle of Platæa, the Athenians and Lacedæmonians
contending for the <i>aristeia</i>, or prize for having behaved
best in the battle, that honour, by the mediation of
the Corinthians, was conferred on the Platæans, whose signal
zeal throughout the Persian war was admitted, on all hands,
to deserve such a distinction. At the same time a yearly
sacrifice was appointed to be held at Platæa in honour of the
slain; and a sort of sacred character was conferred both on
the Platæans and their territory, with the privileges here
enumerated.</p>

Dr. Arnold observes that this is a good instance of that
feature of Greek polytheism by which the gods were
known and honoured as standing in particular relations to
mankind, not as the general moral governors of the world.
Three classes of gods were here invoked, each as having a
special point of honour involved in the observation of the
oaths here mentioned: those whose names were pledged to
the observance of it, and who would be personally affronted
by its violation; the ancestral gods <i>θεοὶ πατρῷοι</i> of the Lacedæmonians,
who would take it ill that the act of their
descendant, Pausanias, should be disregarded, or the tombs
of the Lacedæmonians at Platæa neglected or profaned; and
the local gods <i>θεοὶ ἐγχώριοι</i>, to whom the territory was as
a home, and who must expect to be denied their worship, if
their country should be occupied by strangers, who would
bring their own gods along with them.</p>

The end of Numantia is rather differently related by
Appian, who says, that after being reduced to such extremity
as to eat human flesh, they surrendered at discretion, and
were sold as slaves; Scipio retaining fifty of them to grace
his triumph. The desperate resolution of the Saguntines,
also a Spanish people, confirms the probability of Florus’s
version. Pressed by Hannibal, the elders of the city collected
the most valuable property, both public and private,
into a pile, which they consumed by fire, and for the most
part threw themselves into the flames. The other male inhabitants
slew their wives and children, set fire to their
houses, and perished in them, or else fighting to the death.</p>

Mr. Rooke, the English translator of Arrian, observes,
that “the number here must needs be erroneous, though all
the copies which I have seen have it the same.” The height
certainly is startling, but it is hazardous to conclude that it
must be wrong. Not to rely over&ndash;much on the walls of
Babylon, which, according to the father of history, were
about 350 feet high, the battering towers described by Vitruvius,
185 feet in height, were evidently meant to cope with
fortifications as gigantic in height as those here described.
And after all, the city being built on an abrupt rock, which
might perhaps be faced with masonry, if we suppose the
whole height from the sea to the battlements to be meant,
there is nothing improbable in the statement. The total
height of the fortifications of Malta from the sea, we believe,
is not much less.</p>

<i>Προξένοι</i>. The want of public houses of entertainment
for travellers was necessarily supplied by private hospitality.
He whose fortune it was to entertain to&ndash;day, of course expected
to be entertained in return when he visited the country
of his guest; and thus were formed hereditary connexions
of hospitality, held no less sacred than the ties of blood. By
a natural extension of the practice, cities formed similar
connexions with foreign citizens, who received their ambassadors,
and advocated as far as in them lay both the public
interests of the community, and the private interests of those
of its citizens who required such help. These men were
named Proxeni; the bond of mutual obligation was publicly
recorded, and entitled them to receive as guests the same
hospitality and protection which they afforded as hosts.
Etheloproxeni, below translated voluntary hosts, assumed the
same duties, but voluntarily; without the connexion being
publicly acknowledged, and consequently without being entitled
to that public return which the Proxenus claimed as
his right.</p>

“Probably vine sticks, round which the vines were
trained. To understand the account given in the text, we
must suppose that the individuals whom Pithias prosecuted
were the tenants of the sacred ground from which the sticks
were cut, and possibly had inherited the possession of it from
their ancestors, so that they regarded it from long use as their
own property: just as the Roman aristocracy thought themselves
aggrieved when an Agrarian law called on them to
resign the possession of the national lands which they had
for so many generations appropriated to themselves without
any lawful title. As hereditary tenants of the sacred ground,
the Corcyrean nobles had probably been always in the habit
of treating it as their own: so that when suddenly charged
with sacrilege, in abusing their legal rights as tenants, by
cutting down the trees, which belonged not to them, but to
the god, the owner of the land, they, like the Roman nobility,
had no legal defence to make, and could only maintain their
encroachments by violence.” This is Dr. Arnold’s explanation.
The Roman aristocracy, however, had a lawful title
to the possession, though not to the full property, of the lands
in question. See Penny Cyclopædia, art. Agrarian Law. A
lease of certain public lands in Attica is preserved in the
British Museum (Elgin Marbles, No. 261), in which the devastation
of wood is especially forbidden. See Boeckh,
Public Economy of Athens, English translation, vol. ii. p.
15. The prosecution and amount of fine were, however,
evidently dictated by party spirit and revenge.</p>

Dr. Arnold supposes the silver stater, or tetradrachm, to
be meant, which is worth, in our coin, between three shillings
and three shillings and sixpence; the tetradrachms
vary considerably in weight. The golden stater, which was
worth twenty drachms, ought therefore to be worth from
fifteen shillings to seventeen shillings and sixpence; but a
specimen in the British Museum weighs 132&ndash;3/5 grains, which
is about 9½ grains more than a sovereign. Silver therefore
seems to have borne a higher value in relation to gold in
Attica than it does in England.</p>

The Greeks had rather singular notions as to the sanctity
of temples. To kill a person within the sacred precincts,
or to drag him away violently, was held sacrilegious; but to
wall a suppliant up, and thus preventing his escape to starve
him to death, seems to have been considered venial, since
this mode of proceeding was adopted, in a former instance,
against the king of Sparta, Pausanias. In the latter case,
however, the Delphic oracle pronounced the act a pollution,
and ordered that amends should be made for it to the goddess
whose temple was thus desecrated. See Thucyd. i. 134.</p>

Hobbes seems to consider these <i>ἐταιρίαι</i> as associations
of traders or artizans, such as our corporate companies were
in their origin; which is clearly wrong. They would seem
to have been more like the clubs of the French Revolution,
formed for the advocacy of certain opinions, or to promote

<i>Φιλονεικία</i>, properly that spite which reigneth in two adversaries
whilst they contend, or eagerness in striving. “That
is to say, superadded to the definite motives which lead men
to embark in political contests; they contract, when once
embarked in them, a party spirit wholly distinct from the
objects of their party, and which is sometimes transmitted to
their descendants, even when no notions of the original cause
of quarrel are preserved. Such was the case with the factions
of the Circus at Constantinople, and with those deadly
feuds which have prevailed from time to time among the
lower classes in Ireland. In the outrages committed some
years ago by the parties called Caravats and Shanavests, neither
the persons who were executed for these outrages, nor
any one else, could tell what was the dispute. It was notorious
who were Caravats and who were Shanavests, and this
was all.”—Arnold.</p>

Theophanes, p. 154, 6, ed. Par. 1655. This last taunt
seems rather misplaced in the mouth of the greens, who had
murdered 3000 of their enemies in the theatre. It is not
always easy to trace the connexion and meaning of the dialogue.
This arises partly from the nature of the language,
which very often is hardly grammatical, partly from its abruptness
and frequent allusions to circumstances unexplained
elsewhere. It is also to be found with several various
readings in the notes to the Anecdotes of Procopius, vol.

Comedy is divided by the Grecian critics into three
branches; the old, the middle, and the new. Of the two
latter we know little, since the works of Aristophanes, the
only perfect comedies extant, belong, with one exception, to
the first. It would be foreign to our purpose to enter here
into a description of them; but it may be generally stated
that they were of a milder character; the licence of personality
was gradually retrenched, and with it, the political importance
of the stage. The lines of distinction cannot be
drawn with much precision, but the former of them seems to
commence early in the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, the latter in the
reign of Alexander, which began <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 336. The total loss
of the new comedy, and especially of Menander, is perhaps
the greatest that classic literature has sustained. It appears
from the remaining fragments to have been of a highly
polished and moral cast. But a good idea of its general
form and tendency may be derived from Plautus and Terence,
of whose plays several are little more than translations
from it.</p>

The Athenian judges used beans in giving their votes.
Each received three obols, about five&ndash;pence, for his fee, and
in one of the courts the common number of judges was from
two to five hundred or more. The poorer classes made a
livelihood in this way, and hence there sprung an extraordinary

It has been generally said that Cleon lost his popularity
and incurred this fine in consequence of the representation
of the Knights; but there is no authority for the former
supposition, and the latter is disproved by the mention of this
fine in the opening of the Acharnians, acted the year before,
in the sixth year of the Peloponnesian war. The prosecution
was conducted by the Knights; which probably led to the
mistake.</p>

The readiness of the Athenians to listen to unfounded
and malicious accusations has been noticed in the Knights,
and is a favourite subject of ridicule and reproach throughout
Aristophanes. The following passage of the Wasps is
worth notice:—</p>
<p class="pfp8">Be the fault great or small, this cuckoo song<br />
Of tyranny rings ever in our ears;<br />
These fifty years it slept, but now the cry<br />
Is bandied even at Billingsgate, as stale<br />
As mackerel in July. Suppose a turbot<br />
Should suit your palate, straight the sprat&ndash;seller<br />
Next stall exclaims, “Why, this is tyranny!<br />
No tastes aristocratical in Athens!”
Or if you buy anchovies, and demand,<br />
Gratis, a leek for sauce, some herb&ndash;woman,<br />
Squinting, growls out, “So you’re for tyranny,<br />
Dost think the state will furnish you with garnish?”</p>

See Aristophanes, every where, more particularly in the
Knights. Demus demands from Cleon his ring of office:—</p>
<p class="pfp14">Why, how now, rogue?</p>
<p class="pfp6">This is no ring of mine—it tallies not<br />
With my device, or much my eyes deceive me.</p>
<p class="pfp8"><i>Saus.</i> Allow me, sir,—what might be your impression?<br />
<i>Dem.</i> A roasted thrium,(1) with thick fat enclosed.<br />
<i>Saus.</i> (<i>looking at the ring</i>) I see no thrium.<br />
<i>Dem.</i><span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>What the impression, then?<br />
<i>Saus.</i> A wide&ndash;mouthed gull, seated upon a rock,</p>
<p class="pfp6">In act to make a speech.</p>
<p class="pfp10"><i>Mitchell</i>, p. 245. See also ver. 1260. (Ed. Bekk).</p>
<p class="pfp6 p1">(1) In case the reader should have any curiosity about
Athenian cookery, the following is the recipe for a thrium.
Take a certain quantity of rice, fine flour or grain, boil it
till enough done, then pour off the water, and mix it with
soft cheese and a few eggs: roll the mixture in fig&ndash;leaves, tie
it in a cloth, and stew it for some time in gravy. Then remove
the cloth, pour over it a plate of fresh boiling honey,
and let it stew till it becomes yellow, observing to turn it
continually. Serve it up with the honey poured over it.
Another recipe gives brains and cheese, mixed up with a
rich and highly&ndash;esteemed fish&ndash;pickle, as the ingredients.</p>

The earliest extant notice of this curious question is
contained in the recently discovered Republic of Cicero,
edited by Maii, lib. i. c. 10. As this treatise is not contained
in the general editions of the philosopher we shall translate
it:—“You have heard, Tubero, that after the death of
Socrates, Plato, to acquire knowledge, travelled first to
Egypt, then to Sicily and Italy, that he might learn the discoveries
of Pythagoras; and that he had much intercourse
with Archytas of Tarentum and Timæus the Locrian, and
got possession of the Commentaries of Philolaus; and that,
as the name of Pythagoras was then in much credit in those
parts, he devoted himself to men of the Pythagorean school
and to those studies. Therefore since he loved Socrates
singly, and wished to refer everything to him, he blended
the Socratic humour and subtlety of language with the obscurity
of Pythagoras and that air of gravity given by so
many kinds of learning.”</p>

attack on the moral character of Socrates. Mr. Mitchell has
taken a more moderate and candid tone in the ‘Preliminary

This is described by Xenophon in his Banquet, in a
passage which we must regard as his genuine recollection of
a similar pleasantry on the part of Socrates. Had it been
found in Plato, this might have been doubtful; but it is not
Xenophon’s habit to introduce his master in this ludicrous
manner. At a drinking party in the house of Callias, Socrates
is introduced contesting the point of beauty with
Critobulus. To prove his own superiority, he asks, “whether
beauty resides in man only, or in other things?”</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Critobulus.</i> I think, by Jupiter, that it exists in a horse
also, and an ox, and many inanimate things: as, for instance,
I know of a handsome shield, or sword, or spear.</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Socrates.</i> And how is it possible that these things, being
all unlike each other, should all be handsome?</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Critob.</i> If things are well fitted for the purposes for which
we have them, or are well constituted by nature for useful
ends, even these things are handsome.(a)</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Socr.</i> Do you know, then, for what you want eyes?</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Critob.</i> Plainly, to see.</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Socr.</i> On this ground, then, my eyes would be handsomer
than yours.</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Critob.</i> How so?</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Socr.</i> Because yours see straight forward only; but mine,
which project, can see to the side also.</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Critob.</i> You say, then, that a crab is the best eyed of
animals?</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Socr.</i> By all means: since it has eyes the best constituted
for that which is the purpose of eyes.</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Critob.</i> Granted. But of our noses, which is the handsomest,
mine or yours?</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Socr.</i> I indeed think mine the handsomest, if the gods, in
truth, made noses for us to smell with: for your nostrils
point downwards to the ground, while mine are spread open,
so as to collect smells from all quarters.</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Critob.</i> But how can a pug nose be handsomer than a
straight one?</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Socr.</i> Because it constitutes no barrier, but lets the eyes
look straight where they choose; but a high nose, as if out
of insolence, sets a wall between the eyes.</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Critob.</i> For the mouth, I give up: for if mouths were
made to bite with, you can take a much bigger mouthful
than I.</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Socr.</i> And do you consider it no proof that I am handsomer
than you that the Naiads, who are goddesses, have for
children Sileni, who are more like me than you?</p>
<p class="pfc6"><i>Critob.</i> I have nothing to say in reply: but let the votes
be taken, that I may know as soon as possible what penalty
I incur.</p>
<p class="pfc6">Verdict for Critobulus.</p>
<p class="pfp8">(a) There is a sort of ambiguity in the Greek word <i>καλὸς</i>,
which is applicable to any sort of excellence, whether beauty
of form or aptness to a purpose; so that neither handsome,
nor any English single word which occurs to us, exactly expresses
its whole meaning. Familiarly, indeed, we do use
the term beautiful much in the same way; and speak of a
beautiful woman, and a beautiful cricket&ndash;bat, without meaning
that there is any more similarity between them, either
of form or purpose, than Critobulus, when he applies the
term <i>καλὸς</i> equally to a man, an ox, or a shield.</p>

It would seem to be, in reference to this sort of feeling,
that Plato puts these words into the mouth of Socrates, after
sentence passed on him near the end of the Apology: “For
now you have done this, thinking that you should be liberated
from the necessity of giving an account of your life;”
a necessity which, to take Socrates’ own account of his conduct,
they may have been very glad to be liberated from.
“For if you should put me to death, you will not easily find
such another (though the comparison is ridiculous) whom
Divinity has united to this city as to a generous and great
horse; but sluggish through his magnitude, and requiring to
be excited by some fly. In like manner, Divinity appears
to have united me, being somewhat like this (<i>i. e.</i>, the fly)
to the city, that I might not cease exciting, persuading, and
reproving each of you, and everywhere settling on you all
day long.”—Apol. ed., Bekk., part i., vol ii., chap. 18, p. 118.
Nobody, however, ever heard that the horse was grateful to
the fly. Again, “As to what I before observed, that there
is great enmity towards me amongst the vulgar, you may be
well assured that it is true. And this it is which will condemn
me, if I should be condemned—the hatred of the multitude,
and not Melitus or Anytus.”—Part i., vol. ii., chap.
16, p. 112, ed., Bekk.</p>

Solon appointed a set of officers, ten in number, who
were called <i>ῥέτορες</i>, speakers, to argue and explain to the
people the merits of public questions, for a certain fee. Their
qualifications were to be made the subject of a very close inquiry,
according to his laws. Whether in later times the
appellation was confined to these recognized speakers, or
whether all who were ready to speak and plead causes, as
Lysias, Isocrates, &amp;c., were so called, the author has not been
able to ascertain to his satisfaction; but he believes the latter
to be the case, which is not incompatible with the term still
retaining its special meaning, as the title of an officer. Demosthenes
calls himself a <i>ῥέτωρ</i> (De Cor. 301). In later
times they acquired much more importance. Demosthenes
was a sort of prime minister. In his time, he says, the
orators and generals ran in couples; one to plan and defend,
the other to perform (<i>ῥέτωρ ἡγεμὼν, καὶ στρατηγὸς ὡπὸ τούτῳ</i>,
De Rep. Ord., 173). In earlier times, on the contrary, all
the leaders in Athens were men of action, Themistocles,
Cimon, Pericles, &amp;c., down to Nicias and Alcibiades, though
most of them cultivated eloquence at the same time. Even
Cleon thought it necessary to pretend to military renown.</p>

The passage of Ælian (iii., 17), quoted both by Mitford
and Mitchell, as giving the true solution of the cause of Socrates’
death, contains no solution at all of that problem: it
merely tells us, what we knew on better authority, that Socrates
did not like democracy. Xenophon, Mem. i., c. 2,
does more to support this opinion; for he states distinctly
that the avowed dislike of Socrates to the practice of choosing
magistrates by lot, the bad character of his pupils Alcibiades
and Critias, and his alleged perversion of passages in the
poets, to teach his pupils “to be evil&ndash;doers and supporters of
tyrannies,” were topics insisted on by his accusers in the
speech for the prosecution. Nor is it improbable that such
topics had their weight with many in the multitude of judges
who composed the court, a body too numerous to discriminate
and weigh evidence.</p>

“Seeing Anytus pass by, he said, ‘In truth this man is
self&ndash;important, as if he would have done some great and
noble action, in having procured my death, because I said
that it was not expedient that he should educate his son about
hides, seeing that he himself was held in the highest esteem
by the commonwealth.’”—Apol. Xen., § 29. In the Menon
of Plato, Anytus is represented as taking great offence with
Socrates, for showing that neither Aristides nor Pericles,
nor other great statesmen, had been able to educate their
sons so as to impart to them their own great abilities (he
omits to mention Miltiades, who had a son more eminent
than himself, Cimon): a ground of offence which seems odd
enough, unless we suppose Anytus to have felt that Socrates
was talking at him all the time. Anytus concludes his share
in the dialogue with a caution to the philosopher against his
freedom of speech, and a hint that in all places it is readier
to do harm than good to a man, and of all places, most especially
in Athens. ‘No wonder,’ Socrates replies, ‘that
Anytus is angry, since he thinks that I am abusing men, of
whom he esteems himself to be one’ (Ed., Bekker, part ii.,
vol. i., p. 378, § 34). These men are the <i>πολιτικὸι</i> (see § 42;)
so that Anytus was both <i>πολιτικὸς</i>, and (as being a leather&ndash;dealer)
<i>δημιουργὸς</i>; the two terms used in the passage quoted
from the Apology, and in both capacities it would seem that
Socrates had offended him. One of the commentators on
Plato (Forster, Apol. as above) tells us that the tradesmen of
Athens thought that Socrates corrupted the youth of Athens,
because he disapproved of educating young men, as Anytus
is said to have brought up his son solely to the lucrative
crafts of their fathers, and because he led them into the idle
habit of thinking and talking. It may be observed that the
character of Anytus did not stand quite clear; since, according
to Diodorus, having been sent with a fleet to relieve
Pylos, and having failed to do so, as he alleged, from the
badness of the weather, he was accused of treachery, “and,
being in great danger, bought himself off, being the first of
the Athenians, as it appears, who ever bribed a court of
justice” (Diod., xiii. 64).</p>

which begins at § 25 (part i., vol. ii., p. 128, ed. Bekker);
and his address to the judges after sentence of death
was passed, which begins at § 29 (part i., vol. ii., p. 133).</p>

The Greeks thought it of much consequence that any
momentous business should be undertaken under favourable
omens. Sounds of lamentation were ill&ndash;omened; even the
direct mention of death was avoided when a periphrasis
would serve. The tragic poets abound in instances of this

“Socrates, though it was the common practice for criminals
at the bar to address the passions, and to flatter and
entreat their judges, and by such means often to obtain acquittals,
would, on no account, do any of those things which,
contrary to law, were continually done in the courts; but
though he might readily have gained his acquittal from his
judges if he had done such things even in a moderate degree,
chose rather to die, abiding by the laws, than to live by
transgressing them.”—(Xen. Mem., c. iv., p. 4.)</p>

“Master John Huss goes to Constance, there to declare the
faith which he has always held, holds now, and, by God’s

throughout the kingdom of Bohemia that he was willing
before his departure to give account of his faith at a general

which could be made to it, so he notifies in this

Sigismond is said to have blushed when Huss fixed his
eyes on him; as he declared to the Council that he had
come willingly under the pledged protection of the Emperor
there present. Charles V., when pressed to arrest
Luther at the Diet of Worms, is said, in allusion to this circumstance,
to have used the following expression; “I do
not mean to blush with my predecessor Sigismond.” The
conduct of the two emperors towards Huss and Luther is
well contrasted throughout; and Charles was not a less
zealous Catholic than his predecessor.</p>

The murder of Archbishop Sharpe is the most celebrated
and remarkable of these instances of perverted enthusiasm,
mistaken applications of the Old Testament, and determination
to see a <i>special</i> Providence in passing events. Burley,
Rathillet, and their associates, when they met on the Magus
Muir, had no thought of harming Sharpe: but when his
coach passed that way, they concluded that the Lord had
delivered him into their hands; and therefore they killed
him. For the effect of the persecution, see Fox’s Hist. of
James II. “This system of government, and especially the
rigour with which those concerned in the late insurrections,
the excommunication of the king, or the other outrages complained
of, were pursued and hunted, sometimes by blood&ndash;hounds,
sometimes by soldiers almost equally savage, and
afterwards shot like wild beasts, drove some of those sectaries
who were styled Cameronians, and other proscribed
persons, to measures of absolute desperation. They made a
declaration, which they caused to be affixed to different
churches, importing that they would use the law of retaliation,
and ‘<i>we will</i>,’ said they, ‘<i>punish as enemies to God, and to
the Covenant, such persons as shall make it their work to imbrue
their hands in our blood; and chiefly, if they shall continue
obstinately and with habitual malice to proceed against us</i>:’
with more to the like effect. Upon such an occasion, the
interference of government became necessary. The government
did indeed interfere, and by a vote of council ordered,
that whoever owned, or refused to disown, the declaration
on oath, should be put to death, in the presence of two
witnesses, though unarmed when taken. The execution of
this massacre, in the twelve counties which were principally
concerned, was committed to the military, and exceeded, if
possible, the order itself. The disowning the declaration
was required to be made in a particular form prescribed.
Women obstinate in their fanaticism, lest female blood should
be a stain upon the swords of soldiers engaged in this honourable
employment, were drowned. The habitations, as well
of those who had fled to save themselves, as of those who
suffered, were burnt and destroyed. Such members of the
families of the delinquents as were above twelve years old,
were imprisoned for the purpose of being afterwards transported.
The brutality of the soldiers was such as might be
expected from an army let loose from all restraint, and employed
to execute the royal justice, as it was called, upon
wretches. Graham, who has been mentioned before, and
who, under the title of Lord Dundee (a title which was probably
conferred on him by James for these or similar
services), was afterwards esteemed such a hero among the
Jacobite party, particularly distinguished himself. Of six
unarmed fugitives whom he seized, he caused four to be shot
in his presence, nor did the remaining two experience any
other mercy from him than a delay of their doom; and at
another time, having intercepted the flight of one of these
victims, he had him shown to his family, and then murdered
in the arms of his wife. The example of persons of such
high rank, and who must be presumed to have had an education
in some degree corresponding to their station, could not
fail of operating upon men of a lower order in society. The
carnage became every day more general, and more indiscriminate;
and the murder of peasants at their houses, or while
employed in their usual work in the fields, by the soldiers,
was not only not reproved or punished, but deemed a meritorious
service by their superiors.” Chap. ii. p. 128&ndash;30.</p>

The following passage, with other interesting particulars
relative to these times, is to be found in Scott’s ‘Minstrelsy
of the Scottish Border.’ It is hardly necessary to
refer to ‘Old Mortality,’ as a most vivid and affecting picture
of this interesting period of our history, though coloured
by the author’s prejudices in favour of the dominant party.</p>

We give an abstract, to show both the number and
nature of the crimes which were punished with death.</p>
<p class="pfc6">Jan. 23. Six persons shot, surprised in prayer, in the
parish of Monigaff, Galloway.</p>
<p class="pfc6">Jan. 31. One person shot, taken in hiding, in Durisdeer,
Nithsdale.</p>
<p class="pfc6">Jan. 31. Four shot, for refusing the oath of abjuration.
Straiton, Ayrshire.</p>
<p class="pfc6">Feb. 19. Four shot and two hanged, taken in hiding.
Orr, Galloway.</p>
<p class="pfc6">Feb. 21. Five killed at Kirkonnel.</p>
<p class="pfc6">Feb. 28. One killed at Barr, in Carrick.</p>
<p class="pfc6">Ten others killed in the above month, at different times,
dates uncertain, facts certain. And so on, through the year,
but especially the first half. All these, it will be observed,
are military executions solely, not men slain in fighting,
nor men condemned by the civil power. Wodrow, book iii.
chap. 9. § 6.</p>

Instructions to General&ndash;Lieutenant Drummond for
marching to the southern and western shires. Edinb. April
21, 1685.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“1mo. You are to employ all his majesties standing forces,
in the southern and western shires, or so many of them as
you shall find expedient, for pursuing, suppressing, and
utterly destroying all such fugitive rebels as resist, and disturb
the peace and quiet of his majesties government: and
you are to cause immediately shoot such of them to death,
as you immediately find in arms.</p>
<p class="pfc6">“2do. You shall give order to apprehend all persons suspect
for harbourers, or resetters of rebels, and fugitive vagabonds:
and punish such as you find guilty, according to
law.”</p>
<p class="pfc6">He is farther warranted to take free quarters, for all persons
under his command (not being of his majesty’s forces),
in all places where rebels, and fugitives, and vagabonds are
suspected of being reset, harboured, or connived at.</p>
<p class="pfc6">There is something at once ludicrous and revolting in the
following complaint, and the remedy applied to the grievance.
It is a good specimen of the way in which the Council exercised
their inquisitorial functions:—</p>
<p class="pfc6">“July 14. The magistrates of Glasgow present a petition
to the council, showing that their tolbooth is pestered with
many silly old women, who are a great charge to the town.
The council order them to be whipped and burnt on the
cheek severely, who are guilty of reset and converse; and
such as are guilty of ill principles, that they be whipped and
all dismissed.” Wodrow, Hist. of Sufferings of Church of
Scotland, vol. iii. chap. ix. § 3.</p>
<p class="pfc6">Reset and converse are the harbouring and intercourse
with proscribed persons: <i>guilty of ill principles</i> is a phrase
of convenient latitude; but must be understood to signify
affection to the kirk and covenant.</p>

Burnet says, “he gave no advantage to those that wished
to have saved him, by the least step towards any submission,
but much to the contrary. I saw him suffer. He was so
far from showing any fear, that he rather expressed a contempt
of death. He spoke an hour on the ladder with the
composedness of one that was delivering a sermon, rather
than his last words. He justified all that had been done,
and exhorted all people to adhere to the Covenant, which he
magnified highly.” Burnet, Hist. of his own Times.</p>

By a singular specimen of ignorance, our ancestors,
who held the Mahometans in pious abomination, chose to
consider that sect, which holds images in abomination, as
idolaters. Hence the word mawmet, or maumet, and
maumetry, are continually used in our early writers for
idol, and idolatry. “Unleful worschipping of mawmetis.”—Wiclif,
1 Pet. iv. 3. “When the Byshop Amphiarax
sodeynly fell down into hell,” according to Lydgate, Story
of Thebes, it was the</p>

The principal question argued in this letter is the marriage
of priests. The following extract, which is of Taylor’s
own writing, gives a good notion of the way in which such
examinations might be carried on:—</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Then my Lord Chancellor said, ‘Diddest thou never read
the book that I set forth of the sacrament?’ I answered,
‘That I had read it.’ Then hee said, ‘How likest thou that
book?’ With that one of the Councell (whose name I
know not),(a) said, ‘My Lord, that is a good question, for I
am sure that book stoppeth all their mouths.’ Then said I,
‘My Lord, I think many things be farre wide of the truth
of God’s word in that book.’</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Then my Lord said, ‘Thou art a very varlet.’ To that
I answered, ‘That is as bad as Racha, or Fatue.’(b) Then my
Lord said, ‘thou art an ignorant beetlebrow.’</p>
<p class="pfc6">“To that I answered, ‘I have read over and over again
the Holy Scriptures, and St. Augustine’s works through,
and Cyprian, Eusebius, Origene, Gregory Nazianzene, with
divers other books, through once; therefore I thank God I
am not utterly ignorant. Besides these, my Lord, I professed
the Civill Laws, as your Lordship did, and I have
read over the Canon Law also.’</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Then my Lord said, ‘With a corrupt judgment thou
readest all things. Touching my profession, it is divinity,
in which I have written diverse bookes.’ ‘Then,’ said I,
‘my Lord, ye did write one booke, <i>De vera obedientia</i>: I
would ye had been constant in that; for indeed ye did never
declare a good conscience, that I heard of, but in that one
booke.’</p>
<p class="pfc6">“Then my Lord said, ‘Tut, tut, tut, I wrote against
Bucer in Priests’ marriages; but such bookes please not
such wretches as thou art, which hast been married many
yeares.’</p>
<p class="pfc6">“To that I answered, ‘I am married indeed, and I have
had nine children in holy matrimony, I thank God: and
this I am sure of, that your proceedings now at present in
this realme, against priests’ marriages, is the maintenance
of the doctrine of divells, against naturall law, civill law,
canon law, generall councells, canons of the Apostles, ancient
Doctors, and God’s lawes.’</p>
<p class="pfc6">
“Then my Lord Chancellor said, ‘Thou falsifiest the
generall councell: for there is express mention in the said
decree, that priests should be divorced from their wives,
which be married.’</p>
<p class="pfc6">“‘Then,’ said I, ‘if those words be there, as you say,
then am I content to lose this great head of mine. Let the
book be fetched.’”</p>
<p class="pfp8">(a) “His right name might bee Sir John Clawbacke.”—Fox’s
marginal note.</p>
<p class="pfp8">(b) Taylor had once before twitted the Bishop with his turn
for calling hard names.</p>

to be put on that he might be stripped of them, and thus
symbolically deprived of his pastoral office. The scraping
mentioned below was performed on the parts which were
anointed in the Roman ritual of ordination.</p>
